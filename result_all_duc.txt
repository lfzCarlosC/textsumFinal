known individuals , tried to organize in recent months . </s> <s> The long sentences also crushed the hopes of many liberal intellectuals here that China ' s warming relations with the United States in recent years and its signing of global treaties on human rights might bring a significant easing of political controls . </s> <s> Xu was tried Monday morning in the Beijing Intermediate Court . </s> <s> When after a brief recess the three -

S . District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could decide to rule out some of the new evidence as ranging too far afield from the original suit . </s> <s> But if the government wins its broadened case , the court - ordered remedies would no doubt be far tougher on Microsoft . </s> <s> In May , the government ' s suggested steps amounted to equal treatment for Netscape ' s browser and Microsoft ' s browser . </s> <s> But the government recently asked that the judge hold a separate hearing on remedies , if it wins the case . </s> <s> The remedies under consideration now include more basic changes in Microsoft ' s business practices _ perhaps even a breakup of the company _ intended to loosen Microsoft ' s grip on computing . </s> <s> That would be precisely the kind of sweeping reform that Microsoft ' s foes would applaud . </s> <s> `` The government has doubled the bet and doubled the stakes ,'' said David Yoffie , a professor at the Harvard business school who is co - author of the book , `` Competing on Internet Time : Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft .'' </s> <s> Meanwhile , in the Microsoft camp , the government ' s strategy is dismissed as a desperate act _ taken after a court ruling in June that threatened to undermine the antitrust suit . </s> <s> That ruling came in a separate case , involving the interpretation of the consent decree that Microsoft signed with the Justice Department in 1995 . </s> <s> In the June ruling , a federal appeals court said that Microsoft could bundle its browser with its industry - standard Windows operating system and call them one product . </s> <s> The appeals - court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion in the government ' s current antitrust case that the browser and the operating system were two separate products , bundled together and given away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market . </s> <s> `` With the appeals - court ruling in June , the government lost the heart of its case ,'' said Charles Rule , a former senior official in the Justice Department , who is now a consultant to Microsoft . </s> <s> `` So it has taken a blunderbuss approach of scrambling to throw everything it can find _ even evidence the Justice Department has had for years _ into the gun barrel and see what hits .'' </s> <s> The June appellate ruling did shake the prosecution team . </s> <s> But mostly it strengthened the hand of those within the Justice Department who had been urging that the case be broadened , according to people who have worked on the investigation . </s> <s> At the same time , they say , new evidence was coming in as the investigation moved ahead and prosecutors raced to meet the accelerated trial schedule approved by the court . </s> <s> Speed was a priority from the outset , they say . </s> <s> The Justice Department and the states filed their suit in May to move before Microsoft ' s new operating system , Windows 98 , was introduced in June . </s> <s> While not seeking to block the release of Windows 98 , government lawyers wanted to get to the the courtroom as early as possible as PC makers and computer users adopt this latest version of Microsoft ' s Windows operating system , which functions as the central nervous system for more than 90 percent of personal computers sold . </s> <s> The key allegations , government lawyers note , have not changed since May _ namely , that Microsoft illegally used its market power in operating systems to defend its monopoly position and to try to extend into new markets . </s> <s> `` But the only thing that was wrapped up in a bow in time for the May filing was the browser ,'' said one person who worked on the case . </s> <s> `` The real game plan was always to get a broader case .'' </s> <s> What is more , one person noted , the prosecution team was not at full strength until shortly before the suit was filed . </s> <s> David Boies , a renowned courtroom litigator and a former partner at Cravath , Swaine & amp ;

Microsoft Corp ., the government ' s most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years , is playing out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to support their opposing arguments . </s> <s> Whatever the outcome of the trial , scheduled to begin Monday in U . S . District Court in Washington , an almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines . </s> <s> The case focuses on Microsoft ' s Windows , the operating system that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today . </s> <s> The government says its objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a single company . </s> <s> Microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the government control over which features can be added to Windows . </s> <s> However grand the economic stakes , the legal dispute is narrow . </s> <s> The government says that Microsoft ' s contracts with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the Internet illegally stifle competition . </s> <s> The contracts prohibit manufacturers from substituting Netscape Communications Corp .' s Navigator browser for Microsoft ' s Internet Explorer . </s> <s> They also prohibit them from removing from the Windows main screen , or desktop , links to sites on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or its partners . </s> <s> Microsoft ' s contracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with businesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favored treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links on the Windows desktop . </s> <s> In the wake of the lawsuit , Microsoft has voluntarily dropped some of these requirements , though it could reinstate them at will . </s> <s> Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because they produce tangible benefits for customers , including easier Internet access . </s> <s> The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98 amount to `` tying ,'' an illegal practice that forces customers of one product to purchase another . </s> <s> The contracts with manufacturers and Internet services are illegal , the government says , because they are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but to protect Microsoft ' s existing monopoly in operating systems . </s> <s> The latter threat is key , according to the Justice Department . </s> <s> Browsers have the potential , like an operating system , to act as a software platform on which other programs run . </s> <s> So contracts intended to drive browsers out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly . </s> <s> Many antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice Department is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary . </s> <s> Professor Lawrence White of New York University , who was chief economist of the Justice Department ' s antitrust division in the early 1980s , says that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact it is ubiquitous . </s> <s> No one , he said , `` would challenge the right of manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils , tires to an automobile or buttons to shirts .'' </s> <s> His point , shared widely among economists , is that some tying benefits consumers if , for example , it results in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover development costs . </s> <s> But tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power . </s> <s> The courts , White says , have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing good tying from bad , which is the nub of the legal dispute . </s> <s> Microsoft says it needs only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes what might be called a `` gross '' consumer benefits test _ that it offers an immediate benefit , whether or not it causes long - term damage to competition and , therefore , ultimately to consumers . </s> <s> The Justice Department says that Microsoft ' s practices must clear a higher hurdle : yielding `` net '' consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough to balance possible long - term harm to competition . </s> <s> So which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws ? </s> <s> The simple answer is that no one knows for sure , which is why both sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of embarrassment . </s> <s> Consider a 1985 case , Aspen Skiing Co . vs .

article=<d> <p> <s> The case of United States vs . Microsoft Corp ., the government ' s most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years , is playing out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to support their opposing arguments . </s> <s> Whatever the outcome of the trial , scheduled to begin Monday in U . S . District Court in Washington , an almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines . </s> <s> The case focuses on Microsoft ' s Windows , the operating system that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today . </s> <s> The government says its objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a single company . </s> <s> Microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the government control over which features can be added to Windows . </s> <s> However grand the economic stakes , the legal dispute is narrow . </s> <s> The government says that Microsoft ' s contracts with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the Internet illegally stifle competition . </s> <s> The contracts prohibit manufacturers from substituting Netscape Communications Corp .' s Navigator browser for Microsoft ' s Internet Explorer . </s> <s> They also prohibit them from removing from the Windows main screen , or desktop , links to sites on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or its partners . </s> <s> Microsoft ' s contracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with businesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favored treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links on the Windows desktop . </s> <s> In the wake of the lawsuit , Microsoft has voluntarily dropped some of these requirements , though it could reinstate them at will . </s> <s> Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because they produce tangible benefits for customers , including easier Internet access . </s> <s> The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98 amount to `` tying ,'' an illegal practice that forces customers of one product to purchase another . </s> <s> The contracts with manufacturers and Internet services are illegal , the government says , because they are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but to protect Microsoft ' s existing monopoly in operating systems . </s> <s> The latter threat is key , according to the Justice Department . </s> <s> Browsers have the potential , like an operating system , to act as a software platform on which other programs run . </s> <s> So contracts intended to drive browsers out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly . </s> <s> Many antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice Department is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary . </s> <s> Professor Lawrence White of New York University , who was chief economist of the Justice Department ' s antitrust division in the early 1980s , says that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact it is ubiquitous . </s> <s> No one , he said , `` would challenge the right of manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils , tires to an automobile or buttons to shirts .'' </s> <s> His point , shared widely among economists , is that some tying benefits consumers if , for example , it results in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover development costs . </s> <s> But tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power . </s> <s> The courts , White says , have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing good tying from bad , which is the nub of the legal dispute . </s> <s> Microsoft says it needs only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes what might be called a `` gross '' consumer benefits test _ that it offers an immediate benefit , whether or not it causes long - term damage to competition and , therefore , ultimately to consumers . </s> <s> The Justice Department says that Microsoft ' s practices must clear a higher hurdle : yielding `` net '' consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough to balance possible long - term harm to competition . </s> <s> So which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws ? </s> <s> The simple answer is that no one knows for sure , which is why both sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of embarrassment . </s> <s> Consider a 1985 case , Aspen Skiing Co . vs .

floor conference room at Netscape ' s headquarters in Mountain View , Calif . That meeting , according to the Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft , was the high - tech equivalent of the storied gatherings in smoke - filled railroad cars that inspired passage of the nation ' s antitrust laws a century ago . </s> <s> On that day , they say , Microsoft made Netscape an illegal offer to divvy up the market for Internet browsing software , a collusion pact that Netscape rejected . </s> <s> Microsoft replies that the prosecutors are misinterpreting a routine meeting in the software business and that the company has never tried to divide the browser market . </s> <s> Bill Gates , Microsoft ' s chairman and principal strategist , did not attend the Mountain View gathering , but he consulted by telephone with the Microsoft team . </s> <s> Two people who did attend that June meeting have been named as witnesses in the trial scheduled to begin next week : Netscape president James Barksdale and Daniel Rosen , Microsoft ' s general manager of new technology . </s> <s> In the trial , the government will contend that Microsoft presented Netscape with an all - or - nothing offer , according to people who have been questioned in the federal investigation . </s> <s> Relying heavily on notes taken in the meeting by Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen and on the testimony of Barksdale , prosecutors are expected to assert that the Microsoft proposal had several elements , both incentives and requirements . </s> <s> Microsoft , according to the people questioned by the government , would invest in Netscape , taking a 15 to 20 percent stake , give Netscape technical information and fine - tune Microsoft ' s operating systems so that Netscape ' s software would run better on Windows . </s> <s> In return , the people say , Netscape would give Microsoft a seat on its board , license its technology to Microsoft , give Microsoft advance knowledge of its product - development efforts and not make a browser for the next generation of the Microsoft operating system , Windows 95 , which was shipped two months after the June 1995 meeting . </s> <s> And Microsoft , the people added , did what it has always denied it does _ used access to its technology as a powerful lever in business negotiations , by offering Netscape preferential access to the Windows `` application program interfaces ,'' or APIs , the links that enable other companies ' programs to run smoothly on the Windows operating system . </s> <s> By turning down the deal , Netscape , they say , would not have that preferred access to Microsoft technology _ a threat that Microsoft fiercely denies making . </s> <s> Barksdale , Netscape ' s 55 -

Netscape meeting focused on the division between the operating system _ the `` platform ,'' in computer terms _ and the application programs , sometimes called `` solutions ,'' that run on top of the operating system . </s> <s> The government suit states that in sworn testimony , Chris Jones , a Microsoft manager who attended the meeting , `` admitted that Microsoft ` absolutely ' intended to persuade Netscape not to compete .'' </s> <s> Microsoft reads Jones ' testimony very differently , as evidence mainly of the company ' s clarifying its position . </s> <s> If Netscape stayed on the applications or solutions side of the operating system , the two companies could be partners , Microsoft said . </s> <s> But if Netscape tried to become a player in the platform space , they would compete . </s> <s> Microsoft released portions of the Jones deposition in September as evidence that the government had quoted the Microsoft manager out of context . </s> <s> Q . </s> <s> Do you recall any discussion about a desire of anybody on the part of Microsoft who was participating to be able to persuade or influence Netscape not to compete ? </s> <s> A . </s> <s> Absolutely . </s> <s> But again , persuade in the sense of force or persuade in the sense of , hey , we think we can have a great business relationship together . </s> <s> Later in the deposition , a Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether any of the Microsoft executives intended to suggest that `` there would be any consequences to Netscape or its business if Netscape chose to go in the platform direction you ' ve described earlier as opposed to the solutions direction .'' </s> <s> Jones replied : `` The conversation was something like the following : ` We ' re in the platform business . </s> <s> We ' re going to invest heavily in this part of the platform because we feel it ' s critical to our technologies . </s> <s> That ' s a done deal .' </s> <s> And we ' re asking them : ` What is your business ? </s> <s> Is your business platforms or solutions ? </s> <s> If it ' s platforms , we ' re in the platforms business . </s> <s> We ' re competing .''' </s> <s> Microsoft portrays such comments as innocuous statements of fact . </s> <s> But to Netscape , the same remarks could be taken as a warning , if not a threat . </s> <s> This is because Internet browsing software had the potential to become an alternative platform to the Windows operating system . </s> <s> The browser , sitting on top of the operating system , could supplant Windows as the main desktop screen on users ' machines and the main layer of programming for starting other software applications . </s> <s> In addition , Netscape ' s browser could serve as a powerful platform for distributing and running Java , an Internet programming language developed by Sun Microsystems Inc ., a Microsoft rival . </s> <s> In technical terms , Netscape ' s upstart platform could replace Microsoft ' s APIs as the essential utility of computing . </s> <s> Indeed , Andreessen had boasted in public of Netscape ' s ambition to relegate Microsoft ' s Windows to so much software plumbing underneath the browser . </s> <s> By the June meeting , Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape as a serious potential challenger to Windows , the corporate crown jewel . </s> <s> On May 26 , 1995 , in an internal memo , `` The Internet Tidal Wave ,'' Gates wrote : `` A new competitor ` born ' on the Internet is Netscape . </s> <s> Their browser is dominant with 70 percent usage share , allowing them to determine which network extensions will catch on .'' </s> <s> Netscape ' s strategy , Gates wrote , was to `` move the key API '' into the browser `` to commoditize the underlying operating system .'' </s> <s> THE BROADER INQUIRY : GOVERNMENT SEES ARM - TWISTING The federal government and the states have recently broadened their allegations against Microsoft by adding evidence that it tried to bully Intel , Apple Computer Inc . and other companies to squelch competition . </s> <s> They say that like the Netscape meeting the new evidence fits a pattern of behavior by Microsoft , which has repeatedly tried to limit competition by strong - arming competitors and partners . </s> <s> One episode that fits the pattern , the prosecutors contend , was an effort by Microsoft to pressure Intel to shelve the development of multimedia and Internet software and to limit its cooperation with Netscape . </s> <s> Intel ' s main business is making the microprocessor chips that act as the electronic brains of most of the computers that run the Windows operating system . </s> <s> Indeed , the fortunes of Intel and Microsoft are so closely aligned that the two companies are sometimes referred to as a single , powerful entity , `` Wintel .'' </s> <s> But Intel also employs hundreds of software engineers , mainly at its Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro , Ore . And while Intel and Microsoft are partners , they have also had their conflicts , typically over the direction and pace at which certain innovations should be introduced into the personal computer industry , which they dominate together . </s> <s> Federal and state investigators have focused on Microsoft ' s strong reaction to work being done by Intel ' s software engineers _ a sentiment expressed in no uncertain terms during a meeting at Intel ' s Santa Clara , Calif ., headquarters on Aug . 2 , 1995 . </s> <s> The contentious session was attended by several executives from Intel and Microsoft , including Gates and Intel chairman Andrew Grove . </s> <s> An internal Intel memo stated that Gates made `` vague threats '' about supporting Intel ' s competitors and that he was `` livid '' about Intel ' s `` investments in the Internet and wanted them stopped .'' </s> <s> Later , Intel did pull back from its multimedia and Internet software development . </s> <s> Steven McGeady , an Intel vice president who attended the August 1995 meeting , is scheduled to appear as a witness for the government . </s> <s> Microsoft replies that the government ' s accounts of meetings like those with Netscape and Intel are fanciful distortions , created by using a biased selection of documents and witnesses . </s> <s> The government ' s case , Microsoft asserts , betrays an utter failure to accept the computer - industry reality that Microsoft routinely meets with companies to make sure their software and equipment will work well with Windows . </s> <s> Sometimes the talks , Microsoft says , go on to include further levels of cooperation like licensing technology or a Microsoft investment , as the company discussed with Netscape . </s> <s> In the trial , Microsoft is expected to argue its advance in the browser market was the result of its own business acumen and Netscape ' s missteps . </s> <s> To document Netscape ' s errors , Microsoft issued a subpoena last month and obtained the unpublished manuscript of a new book , `` Competing on Internet Time : Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft ,'' which is based on hundreds of interviews with current and former Netscape executives . </s> <s> The book does chronicle the mistakes made by Netscape . </s> <s> But its authors , Michael Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ' s Sloan School of Management and David Yoffie of the Harvard Business School , think Microsoft is hardly blameless . </s> <s> `` Microsoft ' s take - no - prisoners strategy backfired , all but inviting retaliation from competitors , the government and even customers ,'' Yoffie said . </s> <s> Emphasizing that he was offering no legal judgment , Yoffie added , `` I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it did without crossing the line as much as it did .'' </s> <s> THE SPYGLASS LINK : REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6 , 1994 , Gates and 20 Microsoft executives gathered for a daylong retreat not far from the company ' s headquarters in Redmond , Wash . </s> <s> The subject was the Internet and how it might revolutionize the computer software business . </s> <s> Few concrete plans were made that day , but Microsoft executives insist that a direction was set . </s> <s> `` Our vision from the outset was to unite the two worlds of the Windows desktop and the Internet ,'' said Steven Sinofsky , a Microsoft executive who attended the meeting . </s> <s> Yet Microsoft badly trailed Netscape in the browser field . </s> <s> To hasten its entry , Microsoft licensed its early browsing software from Spyglass Inc . of Naperville , Ill . </s> <s> The first meeting between the two companies was initiated by Spyglass in April 1994 . </s> <s> At the time , it was a tiny company and eager to do a deal with Microsoft . </s> <s> Spyglass was selected as the commercial licensee for browser technology developed by the National Center for Supercomputing at the University of Illinois . </s> <s> In the summer of 1994 , Douglas Colbeth , president of Spyglass , met with Clark of Netscape at O ' Hare International Airport in Chicago . </s> <s> The two men talked in the United Airlines Red Carpet Room , reserved for business - class passengers , and Colbeth recalled Clark telling him , `` We ' re going to take Microsoft head - on .'' </s> <s> At the time , Colbeth recalled thinking to himself , `` Great , now Microsoft will really want to license from me .'' </s> <s> Today , he noted : `` Remember , we were a company with a couple dozen people and almost no money in the bank . </s> <s> Netscape had Jim Clark , with his money and reputation , and big - time venture capital backing from Silicon Valley . </s> <s> Netscape had a very different agenda .'' </s> <s> By July 1994 , Microsoft had become quite interested in the Spyglass technology , Colbeth says , and the two companies signed their first licensing agreement the following December . </s> <s> Microsoft , Colbeth recalls , always told him that it would eventually fold browser technology into its operating system , but its timing was accelerated by Netscape ' s rapid rise . </s> <s> `` Microsoft was initially hoping to charge for the browser ,'' Colbeth said . </s> <s> But on Dec . 7 , 1995 , Gates declared that Microsoft would not only deeply integrate its browser into Windows but would give it away . </s> <s> The announcement caught the industry , even Colbeth , by surprise . </s> <s> At the time , Spyglass had licensed its technology to 82 other companies , including IBM and Digital Equipment , for use in their software products _ a licensing revenue stream of about $ 20 million a year . </s> <s> As a result of Microsoft ' s move , Spyglass saw those revenues vanish within a year , as smaller Internet software companies went out of business and big customers shifted to Microsoft ' s free browser . </s> <s> Spyglass slashed its payroll and scrambled into new niches of the software industry to replace its lost sales , which it succeeded in doing eventually . </s> <s> `` Whenever you license technology to Microsoft , you have to understand it can someday build it itself , drop it into the operating system and put you out of that business ,'' Colbeth said . </s> <s> THE NONOPTION COMPAQ : SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT Well into 1996 , Netscape ' s share of the browser market continued to rise , while Microsoft made little headway , even though its browser was free . </s> <s> Industry analysts and trade magazines agreed that Netscape ' s browser was the clear technical leader . </s> <s> In April 1996 , Netscape ' s Navigator was used by 87 percent of people browsing the Web , compared with 4 percent using Microsoft ' s Internet Explorer , according to Zona Research . </s> <s> So the biggest personal computer maker , Compaq , thought it made sense to give customers Netscape ' s browser instead of Microsoft ' s . </s> <s> But Microsoft would not stand for that _ and Compaq had no choice but to give in . </s> <s> In June 1996 , Compaq wanted not only to load the more popular Netscape browser on its machines but also to remove the icon for Microsoft ' s Internet Explorer , which was delivered to the computer maker with Windows 95 . </s> <s> Microsoft informed Compaq that if it removed Internet Explorer , the computer maker would lose its license for Windows , said Stephen Decker , Compaq ' s director of software procurement , in testimony to federal investigators . </s> <s> The ultimatum from Microsoft was delivered bluntly in a letter headed , `` Notice of Intent to Terminate License Agreement .'' </s> <s> Faced with being denied the essential operating system , Compaq quickly reversed course and kept the Internet Explorer icon . </s> <s> Microsoft asserts that Windows and Internet Explorer are a single product and that Microsoft alone defines what is in the product . </s> <s> Nothing in its contracts , Microsoft adds , prohibits computer makers from including competing technologies . </s> <s> While the cutoff letter Microsoft sent to Compaq seems an unnecessarily hardball tactic when dealing with its largest corporate customer , Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists that `` to take one letter here or one snippet of e - mail there to try to portray Microsoft as an arrogant company is unfair .'' </s> <s> Noting that a Compaq executive is a witness for Microsoft , Herbold said , `` We are totally dependent on tremendous relationships with key companies like Compaq .'' </s> <s> At Netscape , however , the Compaq episode was a watershed . </s> <s> `` That was the singular act that got me going to the Justice Department ,'' Barksdale recalled . </s> <s> Barksdale said he regarded Microsoft ' s tactic of forcing Compaq to buy its browser as a condition of obtaining an essential product , the Windows operating system , as `` an illegal act and absolute proof that Microsoft was a monopolist .'' </s> <s> After investigating the incident , the Justice Department and the states agreed with Barksdale that Microsoft was illegally tying the sale of one product to another . </s> <s> Microsoft replies that it has a long history of adding new features to its operating system . </s> <s> And from the outset , Microsoft says , it intended that Windows and its Internet Explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated , as they are now in Windows 98 . </s> <s> Thus , Microsoft insists , there is no product - tying violation of antitrust laws . </s> <s> In a separate case , a federal appeals court sided with Microsoft , upholding the principle that the company could put whatever it wanted to in its operating system and declare it a single product . </s> <s> But in June 1996 , when Compaq wanted to offer the Netscape product instead of Microsoft ' s browser , most industry experts viewed the browser and operating system as two different software programs . </s> <s> `` It took a long time for the integration strategy to play out ,'' said a former senior Microsoft researcher . </s> <s> `` Back then , integration was basically bolting a browser onto Windows .'' </s> <s> THE ` BALANCING ACT ': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen Case refers to dealing with Microsoft as `` a delicate balancing act .'' </s> <s> That balance swung sharply from the fall of 1995 to the spring of 1996 , when Microsoft used the lure of giving America Online a featured place on the Windows desktop as the ultimate bargaining chip . </s> <s> To gain access to computing ' s most coveted real estate , America Online agreed to make Microsoft ' s Internet Explorer the main browser for its online subscribers , who now number more than 13 million . </s> <s> Yet throughout 1995 , as Microsoft prepared to introduce Windows 95 , the most significant improvement ever in its operating system , Case was knocking on the door of the Justice Department . </s> <s> His complaint was that Microsoft was going to place its new online service , Microsoft Network , a direct competitor to America Online , prominently on the desktop screen of Windows 95 , which was introduced in August . </s> <s> This bundling tactic of using the industry - dominant operating system to market Microsoft Network , or MSN , Case argued , gave Microsoft an unfair advantage in the young but fast - growing online business . </s> <s> The Justice Department listened and investigated . </s> <s> But ultimately , the government decided against taking any action . </s> <s> At America Online ' s headquarters in Vienna , Va ., Microsoft was both feared and loathed at the time . </s> <s> America Online had a designated `` Microsoft watcher ,'' a young M . B . A . who tracked its adversary ' s every move . </s> <s> Above the desk in his small , windowless office was a picture of Gates . </s> <s> Beneath the picture , in large block letters , were the words `` THE ENEMY .'' </s> <s> Though America Online was the clear leader in the online services business , it had ample reason to worry about an all - out assault by a rival as rich and aggressive as Microsoft . </s> <s> When he had visited the Microsoft headquarters a couple of years earlier , Case recalled , Gates had bluntly assessed Microsoft ' s options by saying he could buy 20 percent of America Online , all of it or enter the online business on his own and `` bury you .'' </s> <s> A threat or merely a statement of the facts ? </s> <s> `` A bit of both ,'' Case said recently . </s> <s> `` But he was mainly articulating what everybody at that meeting kind of intuitively understood .'' </s> <s> Yet by 1996 , Microsoft and America Online found they had reason to cooperate . </s> <s> With the exploding popularity of the Internet ' s World Wide Web , the conventional online companies , like America Online and Compuserve , had to provide their customers Internet access as well as their own services . </s> <s> America Online had its own browser , but to keep pace with the rapidly advancing technology it made sense to do a deal with Netscape or Microsoft . </s> <s> For both software companies , a deal with America Online , which had 5 million subscribers at the time , could mean a big surge in browser use and market share . </s> <s> Netscape seemed the natural partner for America Online , since both companies were Microsoft rivals . </s> <s> On March 11 , America Online did announce that it would buy Netscape technology , but it was a standard licensing deal based on a payment - for - use formula . </s> <s> The next day , America Online announced a more significant deal with Microsoft making its browser the default technology _ the browser America Online subscribers would use unless they specifically asked for Netscape ' s Navigator . </s> <s> To win the deal , Microsoft offered to give America Online a start - up icon on the Windows desktop _ precisely the kind of equal treatment on the main Windows screen that Case had asked the Justice Department to require of Microsoft . </s> <s> `` After we agreed to its Internet Explorer browser , Microsoft allowed us to be bundled on the Windows desktop ,'' Case said . </s> <s> `` It was an example of Microsoft ' s pragmatic side .'' </s> <s> The pragmatic decision was that the paramount corporate goal was to increase browser market share to protect the mainstay software business . </s> <s> As a result , its new online service , MSN , would have to sacrifice an important marketing advantage over its main rival , America Online . </s> <s> `` It was Bill ' s decision ,'' said former MSN general manager Russell Siegelman , referring to Gates . </s> <s> `` He sent me e - mail on it . </s> <s> He said he didn ' t think it would hurt MSN that much . </s> <s> I disagreed with him .'' </s> <s> To other Microsoft executives , Gates expressed a different view of the likely impact on MSN . </s> <s> He told senior vice president Brad Silverberg that putting America Online on the Windows desktop would amount to `` putting a bullet through MSN ' s head ,'' according to a deposition taken by the Justice Department . </s> <s> In the antitrust suit , the government asserts that the America Online deal shows how Microsoft used the power of its Windows monopoly to give it an edge in the browser war against Netscape . </s> <s> David Colburn , a senior vice president of America Online who took part in the browser negotiations with Microsoft , is a witness for the government . </s> <s> Today , Microsoft has overhauled its Internet strategy to focus mainly on building popular special - interest Web sites in fields like travel , personal finance , automobile retailing and news . </s> <s> And it is putting these sites , along with e - mail and search features , in an all - in - one site that uses the name MSN . com . </s> <s> `` I still regard Microsoft as a primary threat ,'' Case observed . </s> <s> `` Microsoft has a history of getting it right in the long run , and there ' s no reason to think it won ' t in this business as well . </s> <s> We will always be in Microsoft ' s cross hairs .'' </s> <s> THE LESSON : DON ' T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER At Netscape ' s headquarters in Silicon Valley , the strategy today is one of avoiding head - to - head competition with Microsoft whenever possible . </s> <s> `` Don ' t do something that is in Microsoft ' s path _ that ' s the lesson learned ,'' observed Clark , the Netscape chairman . </s> <s> Silicon Valley ' s venture capitalists , the investors who finance so many of the nation ' s high - tech startups , generally follow the Netscape formula these days . </s> <s> Yet that still leaves ample room to prosper . </s> <s> For while competing directly with Microsoft is dangerous , the software industry as a whole is an engine of wealth creation , job generation and technical innovation . </s> <s> And there is an ambivalent side to the venture community ' s relationship with Microsoft . </s> <s> For if a start - up cannot steer clear of Microsoft entirely , the favored option is to be bought out by Microsoft , which has scooped up many fledgling companies as a way of acquiring promising technology and people . </s> <s> `` Microsoft understands start - up innovation and how to co - opt start - up innovation better than any other high - tech company ,'' said James Breyer , managing partner of Accel Partners , a venture capital firm . </s> <s> As Microsoft has grown , it has come to be seen not merely as a competitor but as a force of nature that shapes the business environment , like a weather front . </s> <s> `` Microsoft is incredibly pervasive ,'' said Stewart Alsop , a partner with New Enterprise Associates , a venture capital firm in Menlo Park , Calif . At the board meetings of the companies in which his firm has invested , two issues always come up , he said : `` One is the price of the company ' s stock , and the other is what Microsoft is going to do .'' </s> <s> In the last few years , Microsoft has offered its guidance during almost yearly meetings between senior Microsoft executives and leading venture capitalists . </s> <s> The meetings are part of Microsoft ' s effort to improve its sometimes prickly relations with Silicon Valley . </s> <s> `` We work hard to provide clarity about where we ' re going and where we ' re not going ,'' said Greg Maffei , Microsoft ' s chief financial officer . </s> <s> Last year ' s conference took place in October at the Quadrus office building on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park , the Wall Street of high - tech venture investing . </s> <s> Maffei led a team of five Microsoft executives who appeared before a group of 40 venture capitalists , one of whom stood and asked the question that seemed to be on the minds of many of his peers : `` How do I invest in a company that stays out of the way of the steamroller ?'' </s> <s> Maffei , recalled one person who attended the meeting , stood up and delivered a brief lecture on businesses that Microsoft was likely to avoid . </s> <s> His list included specialized software for manufacturing , human resources management , computer - aided design and others . </s> <s> But , this person noted , broad swaths of the industry appeared to be designated as off limits _ including new software platforms that might compete with Microsoft ' s personal computer operating system . </s> <s> At one point , Ruthann Quindlen , a partner with Institutional Venture Partners , leaned over to Vinod Khosla , a co - founder of Sun Microsystems and a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & amp ; Byers , and said quietly , `` I guess that leaves us washing machines and toasters .'' </s> </p> </d> 	abstract=<d> <p> <s> Microsoft , Netscape , Internet , antitrust , AOL , Spyglass , Windows , Gates </s> </p> </d> 	filename=NYT19981007.0302	publisher=AFP

article=<d> <p> <s> For the first time in decades , Congress and the White House negotiated tax and spending legislation this year with the budget in surplus . </s> <s> The result was chaos . </s> <s> The lawmakers were never able to agree on a budget resolution _ the framework into which all the tax and spending bills are supposed to fit . </s> <s> This had not happened since congressional budget procedures were established in 1974 . </s> <s> Then , without the discipline of such an overall plan , the Senate and the House could not pass eight of the 13 spending bills needed to keep the government running . </s> <s> So the lawmakers had to stay in session more than a week longer than they had hoped . </s> <s> Finally , they lumped all eight bills together this week and announced an agreement . </s> <s> But the only way they could get this far was to resort to gimmicks . </s> <s> One was to designate $ 20 billion as `` emergency '' expenditures so that programs did not have to be cut elsewhere to offset the new spending . </s> <s> This will use up more than one - quarter of the anticipated budget surplus in the current fiscal year . </s> <s> Another gimmick extended the tax break for Individual Retirement Accounts to couples with incomes from $ 100 , 000 to $ 150 , 000 . </s> <s> This will actually raise a small amount of revenue in the next five years _ the period covered by budget accounting _ but it will make the picture considerably worse in later years . </s> <s> As hard as it was to negotiate a budget in the bad old days of budget deficits , say the politicians involved , it was exponentially more difficult this year . </s> <s> At least in years past , there was a common goal . </s> <s> As much as they disagreed on policy and principle , they were all aiming at a reduction in the deficit . </s> <s> This year , some members of Congress wanted to use the surplus for a big tax cut . </s> <s> Others wanted to pay off the national debt . </s> <s> Others wanted to spend part of it on medical research , schools and weapons for the Pentagon . </s> <s> Others wanted to spend large sums on highways . </s> <s> Still others wanted to continue cutting government spending . </s> <s> And that was just among the Republicans . </s> <s> The Democrats had their own ideas about the budget , and President Clinton laid down his marker about saving the surplus until a way was found to shore up the Social Security system . </s> <s> `` In budget terms ,'' said Robert Reischauer , a former director of the congressional budget office , `` this is like the end of the Cold War .'' </s> <s> There are other differences as well in the way things were negotiated with the budget in a surplus . </s> <s> In 1990 , 1993 and 1995 , when politicians staked their careers on striking a budget deal to lower the deficit , the fundamental question was how to divide up the bitter medicine of more taxes and less spending . </s> <s> Republicans , for the most part , opposed tax increases and favored cutting spending on social programs . </s> <s> Democrats wanted to raise taxes , especially on the rich , and protect social spending . </s> <s> In the end , balances were carefully drawn . </s> <s> But plenty of politicians _ President George Bush , to name one _ lost their jobs in the process . </s> <s> This year , with Democrats and Republicans alike claiming victory , the burning issue was how to parcel out the candy . </s> <s> Democrats got more money for education and farm assistance . </s> <s> Republicans got more money for the military and an extension of popular tax breaks for businesses . </s> <s> Some of the $ 20 billion that will eat into the surplus really will go for emergencies , like relief for victims of Hurricane Georges . </s> <s> But much of the money , like the $ 90 million that will pay for six new helicopters for the national police in Colombia to use in drug interdiction , was designated emergency spending simply because there was no other way to get it into the budget . </s> <s> For the politicians , the new way is more fun . </s> <s> It is hard to imagine that anyone will be voted out of office because of this year ' s budget . </s> <s> But that did not make it easier to reach an agreement . </s> <s> The other big difference is that the principal fights this year were not over money at all . </s> <s> They involved delicate policy issues like needle exchanges , contraception , global warming , immigration and the census . </s> <s> In Congress , there is no consensus on these matters . </s> <s> So the only way policy could be set was to wrap them into the giant spending bill . </s> <s> It may be more pleasant to debate policy than money . </s> <s> But it is probably harder to find a way to split the difference . </s> <s> As long as the surplus lasts , the lack of discipline that characterized the budget -

article=<d> <p> <s> YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled the Yankees to advance past Cleveland in the American League Championship Series . </s> <s> David Wells is 7 - 1 in his career in the postseason and he should have an additional edge against a Padres ' lineup that is generally less effective against left - handed pitching . </s> <s> Orlando Hernandez has four terrific pitches , pitched seven shutout innings in the pivotal Game 4 of the ALCS and earned the start in Game 2 of this series . </s> <s> David Cone should benefit from six days ' worth of rest when he starts Game 3 , as well as being able to pitch in warm Southern California . </s> <s> Mariano Rivera ' s stuff might be as good as it has been all year , and Mike Stanton continues to be a dominant postseason pitcher . </s> <s> Reasons for concern : the erratic Andy Pettitte , who needs a home - plate umpire to call strikes on pitches low and away , and Jeff Nelson , who lost his command in his last brief outing . </s> <s> Offense There were signs in the ALCS that the offense is coming out of its collective slump _ Chuck Knoblauch is getting on base consistently , Derek Jeter is back to driving the ball to right field and through the middle , Bernie Williams had three hits in Game 6 , and Scott Brosius has been a consistent force at the bottom of the lineup . </s> <s> But the Yankees do have holes : Chili Davis will be hard - pressed to catch up to the fastballs of Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby , and Tino Martinez ' s postseason funk is a problem . </s> <s> The Yankees could use a contribution from Jorge Posada , who will start in Games 1 and 2 and may get a chance to drive pitches low in the strike zone , where he can hit with power . </s> <s> Defense The Yankees have the best defense in baseball , excellent up the middle with Jeter and Knoblauch , and at third with Brosius . </s> <s> Nobody ' s really taken advantage of the fact that Williams has a poor arm in center field , but rest assured that Ken Caminiti , Steve Finley and Greg Vaughn will try . </s> <s> The Indians did expose the fact that the Yankees ' pitchers have trouble preventing baserunners from stealing from second to third base . </s> <s> Baserunning The Yankees run well as they take extra bases , particularly Paul O ' Neill , Brosius , Jeter and Knoblauch going first - to - third ; Williams can make mistakes . </s> <s> The Yankees probably won ' t be able to steal against Kevin Brown , who has an effective slide step , but they could be aggressive against Andy Ashby , or the combination of Sterling Hitchcock and Jim Leyritz . </s> <s> PADRES Hitting Except for Jim Leyritz , no one in the San Diego lineup is particularly hot or particularly frightening at the moment . </s> <s> Tony Gwynn hasn ' t been as consistent as he usually is , Ken Caminiti and Greg Vaughn have been streaky . </s> <s> But the Padres are a veteran team capable of putting the ball in play , getting runners on base and then moving them along , and so long as they are getting exceptional pitching , that ' s all they really need . </s> <s> Quilvio Veras , the leadoff hitter , is adept at drawing walks and Steve Finley , who has become more pull conscious in the last two years , could try to take aim at the right field stands in Yankee Stadium . </s> <s> Vaughn ' s power could be a factor if the Yankees ' pitchers don ' t jam him enough to keep him from leaning over the plate . </s> <s> Pitching Kevin Brown is the best pitcher in this series , capable of winning three games if necessary , should Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose to start him in Games 1 , 4 and 7 . </s> <s> But at some point , San Diego will need a big outing from either Andy Ashby or Sterling Hitchcock . </s> <s> When Ashby ' s right , he ' s hitting the corners with his sinking fastball and his slider , and when his command is suspect , he gets pounded . </s> <s> Hitchcock used his split - fingered fastball to great effectiveness against right - handed batters in the first two rounds of the playoffs , but the Yankees ' left - handed hitters may cause him some concern . </s> <s> San Diego ' s middle relief is the weakest aspect of the team , with Randy Myers and Mark Langston from the left side ( the stuff of each has waned ). </s> <s> But if a lead can be delivered into the hands of closer Trevor Hoffman , he ' ll keep it . </s> <s> Defense They mostly catch the ball and avoid mistakes , though they are unspectacular . </s> <s> Shortstop Chris Gomez and the second baseman Veras are adept at turning double plays , and Caminiti won a Gold Glove at third base last year ; Wally Joyner has good hands at first ; the center fielder Steve Finley is extremely quick in tracking down base hits and returning the ball to the infield . </s> <s> Tony Gwynn ' s range is better toward the right field line , not nearly as good on balls hit in the gaps . </s> <s> The Yankees will be able to run on the arm of Vaughn in left field . </s> <s> Baserunning Veras can steal bases ( 24 ) this year , and Finley can in a tight spot , as well . </s> <s> In general , however , the Padres are a slow , plodding team , though Caminiti and Vaughn are good at going first - to - third , and Gwynn won ' t make mistakes on the bases . </s> <s> PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras : A switch - hitter who has more power right - handed ; should try to pitch him down - and - in with breaking balls when he ' s hitting right - handed , jam him with fastballs when he ' s batting left - handed . </s> <s> Steve Finley : A left - handed hitter who likes to pull the ball . </s> <s> Left - handers like David Wells can beat him with breaking balls low and outside . </s> <s> Tony Gwynn : When he ' s hot , he ' s impossible . </s> <s> When he ' s not hitting well , he can be anxious early in the count , and he should be fed breaking balls out of the strike zone . </s> <s> Greg Vaughn : Big - time power on anything high and over the plate . </s> <s> Because he likes to pull the ball , you must pitch him on the outer edge , occasionally jamming him to keep him honest . </s> <s> Ken Caminiti : More power right - handed , a better hitter left - handed . </s> <s> These days , he ' s a good lowball hitter and can be beat by fastballs up in the zone . </s> <s> Wally Joyner : With runners on base , he ' ll try to jump on a fastball early in the count . </s> <s> Is not a strong hitter and can be jammed . </s> <s> Chris Gomez : Like Derek Jeter , likes to hit pitches inside out , to right field and through the middle . </s> <s> He can hit with power if you make a mistake with a breaking ball . </s> <s> Ruben Rivera : An impatient hitter who will chase pitches out of the strike zone . </s> <s> Carlos Hernandez : Looks for the first - pitch fastball in the upper half of the strike zone . </s> <s> Can struggle against breaking balls . </s> <s> Jim Leyritz : No apparent holes right now , can hit fastballs in and away . </s> <s> Best bet is to get ahead in the count and try to get him to chase breaking balls . </s> <s> PITCHING TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch : Hard throwers like to jam him with fastballs because he stands on top of the plate , which is why he gets hit so often . </s> <s> Derek Jeter : Sometimes he has a tendency to chase pitches at his feet , but if you don ' t get the ball in far enough , he can hammer the ball over the wall in right . </s> <s> Paul O ' Neill : The Yankees ' best pure hitter , he sometimes will chase fastballs up and away , particularly after there is one strike . </s> <s> Bernie Williams : A switch - hitter who has trouble resisting chest - high fastballs . </s> <s> When he lays off them , he is a much better hitter , and he did this in the last game of the Cleveland series . </s> <s> Chili Davis : Has a great eye and will work a pitcher deep into a count , but he can be overpowered with fastballs above his belt . </s> <s> Cheats some now to get his bat started , making him vulnerable to off - speed pitches . </s> <s> Tino Martinez : Nothing seems right at the moment . </s> <s> Is anxious and chases pitches out of the strike zone when he falls behind in the count , and isn ' t taking advantage of mistakes when they ' re made . </s> <s> Scott Brosius : A great breaking ball hitter , but he can also drive a fastball a long way when he anticipates , as Cleveland ' s Charles Nagy now knows . </s> <s> Jorge Posada : When batting left - handed , he fares very poorly against splitters , curveballs and sliders . </s> <s> Ricky Ledee : Like all young hitters , he has a tendency to expand the strike zone and chase pitches out of the strike zone after falling behind in the count . </s> <s> Kevin Brown likely will attack him aggressively . </s> <s> SATURDAY ' S PITCHERS Kevin Brown : Best sinking fastball in the game ( 91 - 93 ) mph , a four - seam fastball of 95 - 97 mph to throw high in the strike zone , a slider that breaks down and away from right - handed batters , and a forkball that dives at 88 - 89 mph . </s> <s> Holds runners well . </s> <s> David Wells : Aggressive , aggressive , aggressive , challenging hitters with fastballs . </s> <s> His curveball can be exceptional , and his changeup has improved . </s> <s> Throw strikes : Allowed as many home runs ( 29 ) as walks ( 29 ), but has not allowed a three - run homer or a grand slam all year . </s> </p> </d> 	abstract=<d> <p> <s> Yankees set pitching staff lineup for first three games of World Series </s> </p> </d> 	filename=NYT19981017.0027	publisher=AFP

article=<d> <p> <s> Everyone who knew Dr . Barnett Slepian knew that the slight , graying physician endured a measure of stress that would exhaust , even break , most people . </s> <s> There were the strangers who pawed through the garbage cans at his home and growled `` murderer '' as they passed him in the grocery store aisle . </s> <s> Demonstrators assailed his pregnant patients as they arrived at his office for their checkups , calling him a baby killer . </s> <s> Outside the clinic where he performed abortions two days a week , pickets shouted epithets like `` pig '' to his face . </s> <s> Slepian , an obstetrician and gynecologist by training and an abortion doctor by principle , rarely acknowledged the strain . </s> <s> He might crack an occasional joke at the expense of the protesters who shadowed him at work and on weekends . </s> <s> Then he would do something unexpected , like invite an anti - abortion leader to breakfast or stop and chat with a familiar demonstrator outside the clinic . </s> <s> So when he was killed Oct . 23 by a sniper ' s bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home in the Buffalo , N . Y ., suburbs , a furtive execution that fit a pattern of four earlier attacks on abortion providers in western New York state and Canada , friends and relatives wondered not so much that Slepian ' s work could arouse such murderous violence . </s> <s> He had predicted as much himself . </s> <s> Instead , they wondered , once again , that he persisted in that work , long after other Buffalo doctors had surrendered to the pressure of abortion opponents . </s> <s> `` He was an incredibly fatalistic person who thought that if your number ' s up , it ' s up , and there is nothing you can do about it ,'' said H . Amanda Robb , the doctor ' s 32 - year - old niece . </s> <s> `` And he was incredibly stubborn . </s> <s> He said that women had a right to comprehensive health care and since he was a women ' s doctor , he was going to provide it for them .'' </s> <s> Slepian is the third doctor to be killed in the last five years in bombings and shootings that have killed 7 people and wounded 17 at abortion clinics around the nation . </s> <s> To his tormentors , he was simply an abortion doctor . </s> <s> To members of the abortion rights movement , he was a martyr for their cause . </s> <s> But Slepian was far from either . </s> <s> In interviews with friends and family members , he emerges as more than a one - dimensional abstract _ a conservative who advocated old - fashioned values like self - reliance , a shy man who had rare flashes of anger , a doctor who performed abortions but had no more patience for women who had multiple abortions than for women who had multiple children they did not want or could not support . </s> <s> He was killed because he performed a medical procedure that has become emotional and politicized . </s> <s> Yet there is nothing in his life to suggest he was a crusader in either politics or medicine . </s> <s> Rather , he was an obstinate , unassuming man who did a remarkable thing . </s> <s> Out of contrariness and out of conscience , say those who knew him , he refused to allow anyone to dictate what kind of doctor he should be , and for that , he paid with his life . </s> <s> The clues to Slepian ' s flinty brand of commitment lie , in part , in his upbringing . </s> <s> His was a family that took success for granted even as it teetered on the edge of poverty . </s> <s> To earn money for medical school , he shoveled muck at a ranch and drove a taxi . </s> <s> He made few friends , but those he had were friends for life . </s> <s> When their wives were sick , he called repeatedly . </s> <s> When they were lonely , he flew to their side . </s> <s> Slepian , who was known as Bart , used to tell people that he chose obstetrics because it is a specialty that exposes a doctor to the least suffering , and that he performed abortions because it was legal and the alternatives were so much worse . </s> <s> Slepian often expressed exasperation over women who came to him for abortion after abortion . </s> <s> `` Don ' t they get it ?'' </s> <s> his clinic staff recall him saying more than once . </s> <s> He had the same impatience for women like those he remembered from his residency in inner - city Buffalo , who had child after child and no means of support . </s> <s> `` He had the contempt for that of somebody who had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and made it in the world ,'' Ms . Robb said . </s> <s> He believed that to ban abortions or , just as shameful in his view , to stop teaching young doctors how to perform them , would not correct the human imperfections that he found so irritating . </s> <s> `` There are 1 . 5 million abortions performed in this country ,'' his niece said , `` and he just felt we ' re not equipped to handle 1 . 5 million unwanted children .'' </s> <s> When he was killed , at the age of 52 , Bart Slepian owned an imposing red brick home in the quiet suburb of Amherst , complete with a swimming pool with piped - in music and an assortment of the time - saving gadgets he adored . </s> <s> Slepian ' s trajectory to that comfortable doctor ' s life had been unconventional . </s> <s> His grandfather , a Russian Jewish immigrant who started out selling shoelaces from a pushcart in Boston , propelled all five of his sons into Harvard at a time when few Jews met the university ' s blue - blood standards . </s> <s> His father , in turn , decreed that his own three sons would be doctors or earn Ph . D ' s . </s> <s> `` We grew up in a home where there was tremendous , tremendous , tremendous respect for education ,'' said Serena Robb , Slepian ' s sister , who is four years older than him . </s> <s> `` If you got an A , it was OK If you got a B , you got yelled at .'' </s> <s> The family ' s means did not match its expectations . </s> <s> Slepian ' s father , Philip , had joined his own father ' s business manufacturing leather soles for shoes . </s> <s> Soon after Bart was born in 1946 in Boston , the company failed , so to save money , the father moved his family of six to his in - laws ' apartment in McKeesport , Pa ., and then to Rochester , N . Y . Once settled , Slepian ' s father set himself up as a freelance writer , crisscrossing the country in his old Studebaker , researching the origins of prominent citizens at the Library of Congress and writing their stories for small - town newspapers . </s> <s> He sold articles by the hundreds , and was still writing until his death nine years ago at the age of 93 . </s> <s> The success that was expected of Bart Slepian did not come easily . </s> <s> As a child , he was so shy that he cried when anyone looked at him , his sister recalled . </s> <s> An unexceptional student , he went to a local community college before transferring to the University of Denver , where he majored in zoology . </s> <s> Rejected by medical schools in the United States _ the fate of two out of three applicants in the late 1960s _ he studied one year in Belgium and then enrolled at the Autonomous University for Medicine in Guadalajara , Mexico . </s> <s> His friends remember him as funny and obstinate , a thin young man with glasses and a receding hairline who beat all comers at arm - wrestling and pool . </s> <s> `` Bart had certain beliefs , strongly held ,'' said Richard Schwarz , an old classmate who is an internist on Long Island . </s> <s> `` He always said you shouldn ' t sit around whining about things ,'' Schwarz said . </s> <s> `` He would say , ` Go after what ' s yours and what ' s right .''' </s> <s> Bart Slepian ' s determination surfaced in quirky ways . </s> <s> He once insisted on going to the top of the World Trade Center , despite a crippling fear of heights . </s> <s> To get to the window , he crawled , inch by inch . </s> <s> `` I said , ` You don ' t have to do this ,' '' recalled Schwarz , who was with him at the time . </s> <s> `` And he said , ` I want to do it .' </s> <s> Bart made it count . </s> <s> He felt alive .'' </s> <s> Forced to drop out of school every few semesters to work , he lived in Reno with his sister Serena , a widow who was struggling to take care of two young daughters . </s> <s> She worked as a waitress and a blackjack dealer , sharing her tips with him while he drove a cab , cleaned barns at a ranch and worked as a laboratory assistant at the local Veterans Administration hospital . </s> <s> After graduation , he moved to Buffalo for his medical residency . </s> <s> There he married Lynne Breitbart , a registered nurse 10 years his junior , and scraped together the money to buy an obstetrics practice from a doctor who was about to retire . </s> <s> He had a soothing , unhurried manner . </s> <s> When a patient of his , Patti Durlak , was diagnosed with diabetes , Slepian referred her to a specialist but called every few days for months to help her overcome a fear of the needles she had to use for her insulin injections . </s> <s> `` The other doctor said , ` Just deal with it ,''' Mrs . Durlak recalled . </s> <s> `` Not Dr . </s> <s> Slepian .'' </s> <s> In most ways , he was a typical suburban family man , working six days a week and spending his free time at Little League games and county fairs with his four sons . </s> <s> But by the late 1980s , he and other abortion doctors in Buffalo were under siege . </s> <s> In one notorious 1991 incident recorded on videotape , the Rev . </s> <s> Paul Schenck , one of the fieriest of Buffalo ' s anti - abortion leaders , threw himself in front of the doctor ' s car as he pulled into the clinic driveway . </s> <s> Slepian parked on the street . </s> <s> As he pushed his way through the crowd of chanting demonstrators , Schenck cupped his hands around his mouth and lunged , shouting , `` Slepian , you pig !'' </s> <s> Slepian ' s attempts to separate the abortion conflict from his private life were futile . </s> <s> The protests followed him home and the man who had been so bashful as a boy found himself , uncomfortably , at the center of controversy and attention . </s> <s> Once , he showed his anger . </s> <s> In 1988 , when demonstrators jeered at him from the sidewalk in front of his home as he opened Hanukkah presents with his children , the doctor came out brandishing a baseball bat . </s> <s> He denied he hurt anyone , but a town judge ordered him to repair one protester ' s smashed van window and pay a portion of another ' s medical bills . </s> <s> The outburst surprised his family and friends . </s> <s> It was not Slepian ' s style to make a public fuss , much less acknowledge the stress of being taunted by protesters . </s> <s> `` Stress ?'' </s> <s> his oldest brother Paul responded gruffly when asked about the doctor ' s mood . </s> <s> `` I never heard the word used in my family , except as an engineering term . </s> <s> He said it was a nuisance .'' </s> <s> Mrs . Slepian did not respond to requests for an interview . </s> <s> She expressed rage to The Buffalo News shortly after the shooting . </s> <s> She said that whoever had killed her husband deserved the death penalty and that she would be happy to administer the lethal injection herself . </s> <s> She also spoke out after Schenck ' s brother , Robert , another anti - abortion leader who frequently confronted Slepian , sent a bouquet of flowers . </s> <s> Mrs . Slepian denounced him as `` a hypocrite .'' </s> <s> After the confrontation in 1988 , Slepian turned to civil harassment lawsuits , letters and levity to deal with the protesters . </s> <s> In 1993 , when a man active in the anti - abortion effort was arrested for rifling through the doctor ' s garbage cans at home , Slepian tried to treat the incident lightly . </s> <s> `` They hopefully got the bags full of dirty diapers ,'' he joked . </s> <s> He tried to engage his critics through the local newspaper . </s> <s> He told The Buffalo News that abortion protesters should turn their energies to helping women avoid unwanted pregnancies through birth control and counseling . </s> <s> In a letter to the editor he warned that by repeatedly calling him a murderer , his critics were inciting violence . </s> <s> Slepian accepted that opponents of abortion acted out of moral conviction , his friends said , but resented the personal attacks . </s> <s> `` He thought it tended to demonize and dehumanize him and increased the danger ,'' said his lawyer , Glenn Edward Murray . </s> <s> So Slepian took a step that few of the nation ' s beleaguered abortion clinic doctors dared . </s> <s> He insisted that if he tried hard enough , he might cut through the venom . </s> <s> To the dismay of the staff members who feared for his safety , Slepian began about a year ago to stop and chat with protesters he recognized outside the Womenservices abortion clinic in Buffalo , where he worked two days a week . </s> <s> He surprised a gathering of protesters who were preparing for what they euphemistically called a `` house call ,'' or demonstration at the doctor ' s home , and invited the protest ' s organizer , the Rev . </s> <s> Robert Behn , to breakfast . </s> <s> Their hourlong conversation the next morning was inconclusive , Behn said , dismissing Slepian ' s gesture as an `` attempt to get people to like him .'' </s> <s> He asked Slepian how performing abortions affected him spiritually . </s> <s> In response , he recalled , the doctor said , `` I ' m fine spiritually .'' </s> <s> Slepian , meanwhile , focused more on time away from home with his family . </s> <s> He planned to take a cruise next spring . </s> <s> He bought a time - share apartment near Disney World in Florida . </s> <s> `` He had so many plans ,'' said Ellen Fink , a close friend of the couple for 15 years . </s> <s> `` He wasn ' t done . </s> <s> He wasn ' t done living yet .'' </s> <s> Still , sometimes during the most casual conversations , a shadow would appear . </s> <s> When his wife gave him a gray African parrot for a birthday gift , Slepian joked that the bird would probably outlive him so he would teach it his eulogy . </s> <s> `` He would talk about the funeral he wanted ,'' Mrs . Fink said . </s> <s> `` He said he didn ' t have a lot of friends and wanted all of them to come in separate cars , one in each car , so he ' d have a long procession .'' </s> <s> In the week before his death , Slepian had reasons to be preoccupied with thoughts of mortality . </s> <s> A medical checkup had revealed a blockage of his heart , Mrs .

Barnett Slepian in his suburban Buffalo home and how it fits a larger pattern of organized violence will be done by the FBI , which has jurisdiction over domestic terrorism . </s> <s> For many in the FBI , that ' s a problem . </s> <s> In contrast to the old image of gung - ho FBI agents turning their surveillance machinery on political groups , a number of senior FBI agents privately expressed misgivings about the attorney general ' s latest task force , the second she has ordered to begin a broad investigation into a conspiracy involving anti - abortion violence . </s> <s> FBI officials fear that expanding the investigation could drive the agency over the ill - defined boundary that separates inquiries into criminal activity from those into political causes and unpopular ideas . </s> <s> Today ' s agents are eager to disassociate themselves from the old J . Edgar Hoover days of trampling the civil rights of political dissidents in the guise of serious investigations . </s> <s> They do not want the agency drawn into the middle of the bitter ideological war between anti - abortion groups and abortion rights advocates , who have long asserted the existence of an organized campaign against clinics and doctors . </s> <s> Many of those calling for government help were once themselves subjects of FBI interest as anti - war and civil rights activists . </s> <s> Senior agency officials , including Director Louis Freeh , were starting their careers in the early 1970s and watched in dismay as the FBI was shaken by revelations about Cointelpro , the counterintelligence program that allowed agents to spy on , burgle , wiretap and infiltrate anti - war and civil rights groups like Students for a Democratic Society and the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee . </s> <s> Some officials are dubious that a conspiracy exists to kill doctors who perform abortions . </s> <s> They came up empty handed when Reno ordered the first federal inquiry in 1994 after the killing of a Florida doctor and his bodyguard . </s> <s> The Justice Department conducted a two - year grand jury investigation ; agents pursued some anti - abortion activists using surveillance teams . </s> <s> But investigators never found a specific plot against abortion clinics and staff members . </s> <s> Violence at abortion clinics is only part of the problem . </s> <s> The FBI has in recent years found itself thrown into a minefield of politically tinged cases involving the volatile worlds of anti - government militias , environmental and Christian extremists , white separatists , animal rights activists and Islamic fundamentalists . </s> <s> `` The FBI is very quick to jump from investigating crime to investigating political association ,'' said David Cole , a law professor at Georgetown University . </s> <s> `` When you move from investigating crimes to investigating groups , that all - important nexus to criminal conduct gets lost , the focus gets broader and broader and you start sweeping in all kinds of lawful political activity .'' </s> <s> In response to terrorist attacks like the bombings of the World Trade Center in 1993 , the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995 and the Olympic park in Atlanta in 1996 , the agency has increased efforts to deter such incidents in a major prevention program . </s> <s> In such cases , the Justice Department , the FBI and other law enforcement agencies said they operate under domestic security guidelines that require investigators to find a `` reasonable indication '' that a group is planning to break the law before they can open an inquiry into an organization . </s> <s> Before the authorities can use such intrusive tactics as wiretapping or property searches , they must have specific evidence . </s> <s> Yet FBI agents throughout the country have quietly evaluated the threat posed by a variety of extremist groups through its links to local authorities and informal interviews with the leaders of some groups . </s> <s> Their conclusion is that most of these groups pose little real danger . </s> <s> Much more difficult to investigate are lone terrorists inflamed by the oratory of extremist ideology but who belong to no group , drifting along society ' s frayed margins , `` off the grid ,'' as some agents describe it , without the usual ties to family , friends or work . </s> <s> The profile fits Eric Robert Rudolph , the fugitive wanted for bombings at the Atlanta Olympics , a gay nightclub and two abortion clinics . </s> <s> He has kept his beliefs mostly to himself , although acquaintances hint that he was familiar with religious extremism and hate groups . </s> <s> In contrast , James Charles Kopp , who is being sought as a material witness in the killing of Slepian , left a trail of clues about his motives . </s> <s> He was an early follower of Randall Terry , a leader of Operation Rescue . </s> <s> Later , Kopp was associated with the Lambs of Christ , an another militant anti - abortion group . </s> <s> One law - enforcement official said that the government should do what it does best . </s> <s> `` We should investigate violations ,'' he said . </s> <s> `` We shouldn ' t investigate groups .'' </s> </p> </d> 	abstract=<d> <p> <s> Attorney General to investigate slaying as part of an anti - abortion plot </s> </p> </d> 	filename=NYT19981114.0057	publisher=AFP
article=<d> <p> <s> By outward appearances , Dorothy Hayes ' life seems ordinary . </s> <s> She and her family live in a rambling old home on the shore of Lake Ontario , and every morning , she gives her husband , John , a peck on the cheek before he goes to work . </s> <s> She runs errands , like other suburban moms , and spends much of her day taking care of her children . </s> <s> But one thing sets Mrs . Hayes apart from her neighbors . </s> <s> As a devoted opponent of abortion , the 43 - year - old mother of nine regularly plays host to a series of traveling speakers , priests and protesters _ many of whom have come to Rochester intent upon spreading the word against abortion and shutting down clinics that provide it . </s> <s> She is one of thousands of people across the country loosely associated with anti - abortion groups like the Lambs of Christ who have opened their homes to the Lambs ' founder , the Rev . </s> <s> Norman Weslin , and other itinerant demonstrators . </s> <s> While many _ including Mrs . Hayes _ disavow violent tactics , supporters of abortion rights say that people like her bear some responsibility when the protesters they help blockade clinics or threaten doctors . </s> <s> `` These people who provide Father Weslin with food and shelter when he comes into town to close the clinics are not innocent ,'' said Ann Glazier , the director of clinic defense for the Planned Parenthood Federation . </s> <s> `` It ' s just not credible to say they aren ' t part of the extremist activity that is taking place at these clinics . </s> <s> They are still guilty of interfering with women ' s access .'' </s> <s> But Mary Quinn , a local organizer for the Lambs of Christ who also offers her home to protesters , sees matters in a differing light . </s> <s> `` Taking people in like this is an act of Christian charity ,'' Mrs . Quinn said . </s> <s> ` People who travel around the country doing this work are taken in by those of us that who don ' t want to lose their stupid houses . </s> <s> We take in these people because they are willing to make the sacrifice .'' </s> <s> Members of the Lambs of Christ have been persistent figures in protests at the Buffalo women ' s clinic where Dr . Barnett Slepian worked before he was shot to death last month . </s> <s> Although no suspect has been identified in the shooting or in several similar attacks in New York and Canada over the past several years , officials are looking to question a Vermont man whose car was seen near Dr . Slepian ' s home . </s> <s> That man , James Charles Kopp , has participated in abortion protests for more than a decade , and often was a house guest of other members of the Lambs of Christ . </s> <s> While Mrs . Hayes says she would never so much as obstruct a clinic ' s door , some of those to whom she has given refuge have no qualms about doing so . </s> <s> Weslin , the leader of the Lambs of Christ , is one of those who has benefited from Mrs . Hayes ' hospitality , a modern version of the generosity that Christ and the Apostles knew well . </s> <s> He prides himself on being arrested more than 60 times during protests in front of medical clinics . </s> <s> And throughout the 1980s and early ' 90s , he was active in clinic `` rescues ,'' in which protesters tried physically to restrain patients trying to enter clinics . </s> <s> Weslin stayed at Mrs . Hayes ' home only once , beginning in May 1996 when he first came to speak at local churches about the anti - abortion movement . </s> <s> But during a stay that lasted several months , he was arrested on Federal charges of blocking access to a Rochester health clinic where abortions were performed . </s> <s> He was later convicted and served two and a half months in prison . </s> <s> During the protest outside the clinic , he and several other protesters locked themselves in a homemade contraption called `` the oven ,'' made of cement and iron . </s> <s> It took police officers several hours to lug the device to a horse trailer that carted it off . </s> <s> At the same protest , one man glued his head to a lock on a gate surrounding the clinic , a move some protesters later said was an accident . </s> <s> Abortion opponents like Mrs . Hayes and Mrs . Quinn speak of attending peaceful observances at abortion clinics and offering prayers for the unborn . </s> <s> They talk about counseling women about alternatives to abortion at Roman Catholic `` pregnancy centers ,'' and their support of anti - abortion candidates . </s> <s> But they also say they saw nothing wrong with Weslin trying to block access to clinics . </s> <s> They describe the activity as peaceful resistance meant to stop what they see as murders . </s> <s> Weslin and the other house guests of Mrs . Hayes and Mrs . Quinn come recommended from friends and members of local Catholic churches , they said , adding that most are speakers at local churches or anti - abortion events . </s> <s> And although they say they would never take into their homes a stranger wanted by the FBI , like Kopp , they concede that they sometimes know little about their guests . </s> <s> But Mrs . Hayes and Mrs . Quinn say they know a lot about Weslin . </s> <s> An Army veteran , he has been a leader of the anti - abortion movement for more than 25 years , they say , and founded a home for unwed mothers . </s> <s> Mrs . Hayes said that when she met him , it was obvious he was a man of peace who `` had a tremendous devotion to the Blessed Mother and basically recognized that we are helpless lambs .'' </s> <s> Barbara Fredericks , another local abortion opponent who developed ties to the Lambs after Weslin came to town , added that the priest epitomized a man of God . </s> <s> `` I just knew when I looked at his holy shoes and his simple coat that had been mended 50 times ,'' she said . </s> <s> `` He was humble , a man who was doing this for a higher purpose , trying to save people through sacrifice and prayer .'' </s> <s> opp also has robust defenders among the people who housed him as he rode about the country from protest to protest . </s> <s> E . Kenny , 20 , said that his parents housed Kopp in their St . Albans , Vt ., home for two years after he spoke at their local church in 1988 . </s> <s> During Kopp ' s stay , he was a pleasure , Kenny said , always helping around the house . </s> <s> `` He was a nice guy , kind of like an uncle to us ,'' Kenny said . </s> <s> `` He ' d sit around and play video games with us and make us model planes out of wood .'' </s> <s> Like Weslin , Kopp was consumed by a need to fight abortion and often talked about its evils , Kenny said , adding that Kopp was a gentle man who wanted to become a Catholic priest . </s> <s> `` He was always in a good mood ,'' Kenny said . </s> <s> `` He never did anything violent at all .'' </s> <s> Both Kopp and Weslin have been arrested repeatedly during abortion protests . </s> <s> The men have moved in the same circles and at times found themselves arrested at the same events . </s> <s> Mrs . Quinn said that Weslin told her in a recent telephone conversation that he knew Kopp . </s> <s> Weslin could not be reached for comment , but it is clear that the two men have encountered each other . </s> <s> Both faced misdemeanor charges after blocking a Burlington , Vt ., health clinic in 1990 that Kopp called `` the mill .'' </s> <s> And they spent time in the same jail in Atlanta in 1988 after a clinic protest . </s> <s> Slepian ' s death has abortion opponents like Mrs . Hayes and Mrs . Quinn worried , both about how the killing is being portrayed in the media and what it will do to membership in groups like the Lambs of Christ . </s> <s> `` For a long time , you felt like the voice in the desert that wasn ' t being heard ,'' Mrs . Hayes said . </s> <s> `` And then there was this horrible tragedy of this doctor ' s death becoming the face of the movement . </s> <s> `` We ' re about saving lives ,'' she said . </s> <s> The FBI has not talked to Mrs . Hayes , but Kenny said that agents have spoken to him . </s> <s> The Justice Department says that a Federal task force set up this week to investigate the killing of Slepian is looking for evidence connecting anti - abortion violence at various clinics . </s> <s> `` It ' s fair to say that when investigating these events , we will look at any connection between individuals engaged in criminal conduct ,'' Myron Marlin , a spokesman for the department , said . </s> <s> Many local Catholics associated with the Lambs of Christ have tried to distance themselves from the killing of Slepian . </s> <s> They are mailing literature saying that the killer does not represent their movement . </s> <s> In addition , some people associated with the Lambs are offering other possible explanations for the killing . </s> <s> Some say they believe that the killer might have been someone overcome by grief after a personal experience with abortion . </s> <s> Others wondered whether the shooter had tried to wound the doctor to scare him or prevent him from performing more abortions . </s> <s> The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents are being blamed for a shooting committed by a disgruntled patient . </s> <s> One idea gaining currency among the Lambs , and prominently displayed on their Web site , suggests that the killing was the result of a plot by abortion supporters to discredit abortion opponents just before last week ' s elections . </s> <s> Mrs . Hayes says she doesn ' t know the truth . </s> <s> `` There are wackos who travel around and they may be in front of the clinic because we are drawn to the same place ,'' she said . </s> <s> `` But you don ' t know everyone who shows up and you don ' t turn to the person next to you and tell them they don ' t belong there .'' </s> <s> Mrs . Fredericks said that anyone who would shoot a doctor who provides abortions was someone `` who had snapped , perhaps because of the importance of the situation .'' </s> <s> Members of the Lambs of Christ and other opponents of abortion in Rochester wonder whether the killing of Slepian will hinder their efforts . </s> <s> When Weslin first arrived two years ago , he brought new focus to a group that often had done little more than counsel pregnant women and set up booths on college campuses , they said . </s> <s> `` In many cities , they have a priest for life coordinating and leading rosary marches '' against abortion , Mrs . Quinn said . </s> <s> `` But with Father Weslin coming here , we could finally come together and feel like we were doing something sacrificial as a group .'' </s> <s> Mrs . Hayes said that she felt the first pull of the movement in the early 1980s , when she heard women speak about `` choice '' in regard to abortion . </s> <s> Then she saw `` Silent Scream ,'' a well - known anti - abortion film that purports to show the footage of an abortion . </s> <s> `` What I saw was the end of life ,'' she said . </s> <s> She began to volunteer at a Catholic pregnancy center where she encouraged women `` not to kill their child .'' </s> <s> She also began to house unwed mothers and went to stand vigil outside local clinics where abortions were performed . </s> <s> Mrs .

article=<d> <p> <s> The slaying of Dr .

Stephen Wear , co - director of the center for clinical ethics at the University of Buffalo , which trains doctors for the Buffalo area ' s hospitals . </s> <s> `` For everybody else , it ' s less and less available .'' </s> <s> The number of abortions in the United States has been declining steadily since the first years after the Supreme Court ' s Roe vs .

article=<d> <p> <s> The deal that South Africa ' s Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered was simple enough : Confess your crimes , apply for amnesty and you will go free . </s> <s> If you don ' t come forward , you will be prosecuted . </s> <s> After more than two years of hearings into apartheid - era atrocities , the commission last week unveiled a 3 , 500 - page report naming dozens of people it believes were up to their elbows in the gore but never applied for amnesty . </s> <s> So the prosecutions should begin soon , right ? </s> <s> Not so fast . </s> <s> The study was barely in the hands of President Nelson Mandela before talk of new amnesty deals had begun . </s> <s> It seems that nearly all of South Africa ' s political parties _ including the ruling African National Congress _ have key officials who could end up in the dock because of the report . </s> <s> Suddenly , there is lots of talk about how the country can ' t withstand a round of politically divisive trials , and many political analysts here are betting that an agreement `` of mutual benefit '' is in the offing . </s> <s> Already , three major political parties are calling for some kind of new amnesty , and the ANC isn ' t closing the door . </s> <s> ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said it was `` premature '' to talk of a general amnesty , but he acknowledged that the party was discussing an amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South Africans against other blacks that littered the KwaZulu / Natal province with bodies during the late ' 80s and into the ' 90s . </s> <s> In choosing a truth commission rather than a Nuremberg - style trial with which to close out its brutal past , South Africa hoped for an idealistic reconciliation . </s> <s> People would come clean and receive true forgiveness . </s> <s> Society would then be able to move on , its wounds cleansed and healed . </s> <s> It was a model watched closely around the world by other societies wondering how to disentangle themselves from the grudges of a brutal past . </s> <s> But given the chance , hundreds of South Africa ' s perpetrators did not come forward . </s> <s> Commission officials themselves say they were frustrated by the lack of cooperation , however exhaustive their report may seem . </s> <s> It is perhaps too late , however , to press for more . </s> <s> Today ' s South Africa has urgent new problems to deal with _ unemployment , crime , white flight , too few schools and hospitals . </s> <s> So it may wind up settling for a more pragmatic reconciliation _ one that gives amnesty to the unrepentant simply because it ' s more practical for all concerned to move on . </s> <s> In recent years , truth commissions have gained popularity in many places , notably Chile , Argentina and El Salvador . </s> <s> But South Africa ' s _ the biggest and most powerful , able to grant amnesty and to subpoena witnesses _ was supposed to be the real test . </s> <s> Certainly the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome details of its past , as sobbing survivors and stone - faced torturers told of smashed genitals and near suffocations . </s> <s> And the commission ' s work added much to the knowledge about what happened in South Africa between 1960 and 1994 . </s> <s> But it will be years before the effect of the commission can truly be judged . </s> <s> Has anyone really forgiven anyone else ? </s> <s> Will vendettas persist ? </s> <s> No one can answer . </s> <s> One thing seems clear , however : Four years after South Africa held its first non - racial elections , a growing number of South Africans want to be done with the past . </s> <s> Raymond Louw , the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter , Southern Africa Report , says a new amnesty proposal could come up during the February session of Parliament , in time to remove the issue from next year ' s election campaigns . </s> <s> `` You simply can ' t have this country torn apart by prosecutions ,'' he says . </s> <s> `` Everybody is going to be howling for an amnesty . </s> <s> They already are .'' </s> <s> Even as Archbishop Desmond Tutu , the commission ' s chairman , delivered the report , he seemed to be anticipating a push for a new amnesty and arguing against it . </s> <s> He said such a move would be highly unfair to those who came forward . </s> <s> He suggested instead that there be a two - year time limit , after which anyone not indicted would in effect get amnesty . </s> <s> To be sure , there will be opposition to any proposals to limit prosecutions . </s> <s> More than a dozen human rights and victims advocacy groups have already banded together to condemn such proposals as `` unconscionable .'' </s> <s> The idea for a Truth Commission emerged as a compromise from the long negotiations that brought about South Africa ' s peaceful transition from a white supremacist state to a non - racial democracy . </s> <s> During the talks , the white National Party government pushed for a blanket amnesty , and the ANC refused . </s> <s> In the end , only about 250 former police officers came forward , most of them foot soldiers . </s> <s> And only two high National Party officials , former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe , confessed _ to roles in ordering bombings . </s> <s> In its report , the commission called the apartheid state the `` primary perpetrator '' of gross human rights violations and held such high ranking former officials as former President P .

raisers , raising concerns about a D ' Amato endorsement . </s> <s> Some New York advocates of civil rights for gay people have flooded the organization with phone calls , e - mail messages and letters . </s> <s> Democratic officials have been encouraging the group ' s major donors to express their opposition to D ' Amato . </s> <s> People involved in the lobbying efforts said that at best , they are hoping the group will endorse both candidates , or make no endorsement at all . </s> <s> `` Chuck Schumer has been a strong supporter of issues that are important to gay communities ,'' said a senior White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity . </s> <s> `` The last thing that they should want to do is hurt the candidacy of someone who has been so supportive of their agenda .'' </s> <s> The Human Rights Campaign is considered the most influential gay and lesbian organization in Washington , with a national membership of 250 , 000 and an annual budget of more than $ 13 million . </s> <s> The group was created in the early 1980s in large part to counter the rise of the Christian right and Ronald Reagan . </s> <s> Paradoxically , D ' Amato was first elected in the Reagan landslide of 1980 and remained a strong supporter of President Reagan . </s> <s> For D ' Amato , who has aggressively courted gay voters , the endorsement would represent a crowning achievement in his efforts to reposition himself as a moderate . </s> <s> Since 1993 , the senator has backed the right of gay citizens to serve in the military , sponsored legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay workers and opposed his own leadership ' s attempts to block the nominations of two openly gay men to positions in the Clinton administration . </s> <s> To gay supporters of D ' Amato , an endorsement by the Human Rights Campaign would signify the political maturation of the gay electorate and help the organization insulate itself from accusations that it is too close to the Democratic Party . </s> <s> Those who support a D ' Amato endorsement , including top officials within the Human Rights Campaign , contend that in the current political climate , where Congress is almost certain to remain under Republican control after November , gay people must build alliances with moderate Republicans . </s> <s> Human Rights Campaign officials also say their standing policy is to support friendly incumbents , even when their challengers have better voting records on gay issues . </s> <s> That is the case in New York , where Schumer ' s rating by the Human Rights Campaign has been consistently better than D ' Amato ' s . </s> <s> Both men , however , have angered advocates of rights for gay people by voting for legislation that allows states to not recognize gay marriages . </s> <s> In a precedent widely cited by D ' Amato supporters , the organization endorsed Sen .

Lewinsky might affect turnout . </s> <s> For a long time , politicians assumed that dispirited Democrats would stay home as a rebuke to Clinton , just as many Republicans did in November 1974 , three months after President Richard M . Nixon resigned . </s> <s> But now some analysts wonder if the partisan fight in Congress last week might have the opposite effect among some Democrats . </s> <s> `` That ' s the problem ,'' said Stuart Rothenberg , the editor of an independent political newsletter in Washington . </s> <s> `` It ' s not that we don ' t know , and that the politicians don ' t know , where the general public stands on impeachment . </s> <s> The problem is that we don ' t know where the electorate stands on impeachment .'' </s> <s> And asking voters to think ahead to an impeachment proceeding as they cast their ballots in a Senate race is , in the words of Stuart Stevens , a Republican consultant , `` a double bank - shot .'' </s> <s> Such strategies , he said , tend to work only with a small number of single - minded or sophisticated voters . </s> <s> Against that complicated backdrop , the prevailing thinking is that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race , state to state and week to week , depending on the circumstances of the candidates and the composition of the electorate . </s> <s> If Democrats try to turn the image of Clinton in the dock to their advantage , it would be in states with a Democratic edge or with sizable numbers of black voters , who overwhelmingly support the president . </s> <s> In contests like those , it might well prove to be in the interest of a Democratic candidate to , as one consultant put it , sit down in front of a camera and tape an advertisement in which the candidate denounces the president ' s behavior but solemnly pledges to vote against impeachment . </s> <s> Strategists in both parties believe that kind of approach could prove effective . </s> <s> `` This is an issue where there is a huge disconnect between the elites and the public ,'' said Fred Yang , a Democratic consultant with clients in Wisconsin and the Carolinas . </s> <s> That kind of Democratic strategy might emerge in California , New York , Illinois , Wisconsin , Washington and perhaps Arkansas . </s> <s> By contrast , Democrats in South Carolina , Georgia and Nevada would be less likely to oppose Clinton ' s impeachment . </s> <s> On the other side , Republican consultants are telling their candidates to stress Clinton ' s misdeeds and stay away from talk of impeachment . </s> <s> The last thing the party wants is to turn the Senate elections into a referendum on whether Clinton should be forced from office . </s> <s> `` The White House might think from the overall public numbers that maybe they would like to make this a referendum election ,'' said Ed Goeas , a Republican pollster who is working in Senate races this year . </s> <s> `` Republicans certainly aren ' t going to let that happen .'' </s> <s> D ' Amato responded to questions about Clinton with the language that Republican consultants have been suggesting to their candidates . </s> <s> `` When and if that matter comes to the Senate , I will decide on the facts that are presented to me at that time ,'' D ' Amato said . </s> <s> `` It would be very premature for me to suggest any course of action without it being referred . </s> <s> Because , indeed , we may be called upon to act as a jury of some kind .'' </s> <s> But Schumer , a member of the House Judiciary Committee , which is conducting the impeachment investigation , virtually embraced the issue . </s> <s> In a live telecast of the hearings , he said the president deserved a lesser punishment , such as censure or reprimand . </s> <s> And Schumer plans to campaign in New York on Monday with Clinton at his side . </s> <s> Schumer ' s media adviser , Hank Morris , seemed to suggest last week that impeachment will grow as an issue . </s> <s> `` Senator D ' Amato claims he does not want to share his opinion with the people of New York ,'' Morris said . </s> <s> `` And if he doesn ' t have an opinion , he ' s the only New Yorker who doesn ' t have an opinion .'' </s> <s> Asked if Schumer would raise the issue in a television commercial , Morris responded : `` We don ' t talk about what we ' re going to do . </s> <s> I wouldn ' t rule it in and I wouldn ' t rule it out .'' </s> </p> </d> 	abstract=<d> <p> <s> Sen .

S . funds to the bailout of Mexico . </s> <s> But administration officials said last week that their early soundings indicate that members of Congress are deeply concerned about preventing an economic collapse in Latin America that would resound in the United States , and thus they expect few objections . </s> <s> The timing of an aid package for Brazil _ originally expected within the next few days _ is complicated by unexpected delays that have cropped up in dealing with the Brazilian government . </s> <s> The government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso faces politically risky gubernatorial elections on Sunday , which may well determine whether Brazil can execute an austerity program that is the key condition for the loans it is concurrently negotiating with the International Monetary Fund . </s> <s> The biggest role in the rescue program for Brazil will be taken by the International Monetary Fund , which said last week that it would contribute at least $ 15 billion _ and appears to be under pressure from the United States to do even more . </s> <s> Another $ 9 billion or so will come from the World Bank and the Inter - American Development Bank , and the remainder from the United States and other major industrial nations . </s> <s> Germany and Japan , though , have been reluctant to take part , one U .

S . aid to Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message : that after a year of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund , the United States is now ready to put a limited amount of its own capital at risk to prevent further havoc _ not only for Brazil but to stop chaos spreading to Argentina , Mexico and other countries that are major U . S . trading partners . </s> <s> That would be a change of strategy . </s> <s> So far , the United States has operated almost entirely through international financial institutions , chiefly the IMF But it would also be a risky move for President Clinton , economically and politically . </s> <s> Even though Congress objected to the $ 20 billion in U . S . funds committed to the bailout of Mexico , it turned out that only $ 12 billion was ultimately needed , and it has since been paid back , with interest . </s> <s> But Rubin noted on Friday that `` it ' s a very different environment now .'' </s> <s> Other administration officials say they believe that there would be few objections in Congress to direct U . S . participation in a Brazil bailout . </s> <s> `` I think there are a lot more people in Congress who are now scared to death by what ' s been happening in the markets , and what could happen in their own districts ,'' a White House official said last week , `` and they won ' t say much as long as they don ' t have to vote on it .'' </s> <s> By acting soon to stabilize Latin America , the administration is hoping to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late - summer panic that engulfed Russia and , at its height , led to an outflow of a billion dollars a day from Brazil , for fear that it would be the next country forced to devalue its currency . </s> <s> Whether this calm marks the beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfires that have erupted since Thailand ' s currency crisis in July 1997 is a matter of considerable debate . </s> <s> But many experts cite the confluence of several events that have reassured jittery investors around the world : two successive interest - rate cuts in the United States , Japan ' s long - delayed move to prop up its banking system with $ 500 billion in taxpayer funds , and a steady strengthening of currencies in Thailand , Indonesia and South Korea , the first signs that investors may be preparing to return . </s> <s> Always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly on markets , Rubin acknowledged that `` in the last several weeks there have been a number of significant , positive developments .'' </s> <s> But the former trader , burned during a 26 - year career by many false market rallies , warned that `` serious issues remain '' and that `` it will take some time for the world to work its way out '' of what he has repeatedly called `` the most serious international financial disruption of the last 50 years .'' </s> <s> In fact , Rubin ' s aides are clearly nervous about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new round of panic , which has made it virtually impossible for many emerging - market countries to borrow money on world markets . </s> <s> `` Brazil and Japan are the two obvious tinderboxes ,'' said Jeffrey Garten , dean of the Yale School of Management , who served as undersecretary of commerce for international affairs during Clinton ' s first term . </s> <s> `` In Brazil , the issue is whether the package that is coming together will really be big enough to deal with an exploding debt problem . </s> <s> And in Japan the question is whether there is real reform that goes along with the money .'' </s> <s> But after spending 18 months in negotiations with the Japanese , Rubin clearly senses that the United States has little leverage in Tokyo ; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock , not lack of resources . </s> <s> In Brazil , though , the United States has a better chance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program , as long as it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to Cardoso and his team . </s> <s> But demonstrating economic support will probably require tapping the Exchange Stabilization Fund , created during the Roosevelt administration to help stabilize the dollar . </s> <s> The money is under Rubin ' s control , with presidential approval , and he reached into it to circumvent congressional objections to aiding Mexico in 1995 . </s> <s> But the reaction was so strong _ for a time Congress restricted tapping the fund for international bailouts _ that Rubin has been extraordinarily cautious ever since . </s> <s> He committed $ 3 billion in a `` second line of defense '' in emergency aid programs for Indonesia and South Korea last year , but no money was ultimately dispersed to either country . </s> <s> U . S . officials said that South Korea did not need the extra help , and that the collapse of the Suharto government in Indonesia so changed the political scene there that it would be too risky to offer direct U . S . aid . </s> <s> In the bailout of Russia _ whose economy collapsed after President Boris Yeltsin abandoned an agreement to reform the economy and dismissed the leading reformers _ the United States offered no direct help . </s> <s> Those events set off a panicked exit by investors from all emerging markets , and greatly worsened Brazil ' s troubles . </s> <s> So far , Brazilian officials have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking about a forthcoming aid program from the IMF , convincing speculators that it would be dangerous to bet against the country . </s> <s> But at the same time , the Brazilian officials have maintained the pose that they do not really need the cash _ and are certainly in no hurry to get it . </s> <s> U . S . officials and top officials of the IMF are clearly nervous , worried that the longer the negotiations drag on , the greater will be the risk of Brazil being caught in another round of market turmoil . </s> <s> `` The Brazilians want everyone to think that it ' s all under control ,'' said an investment banker involved in the talks . </s> <s> `` But the fact is that there ' s still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 months the government is going to be forced to devalue '' its currency , which is pegged to the dollar , but adjusts about 7 . 5 percent a year in a carefully controlled fall . </s> <s> To prevent a sudden devaluation , the Brazilian government has had to raise interest rates to more than 50 percent , choking off credit for most companies . </s> <s> Meanwhile , the country is slipping into recession . </s> <s> The aid would buy time for the Brazilians , but it is contingent on Cardoso ' s success in persuading the legislature to end huge deficits , chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending . </s> <s> The first deputy managing director for the International Monetary Fund , Stanley Fischer , spent Friday in Brazil to review the country ' s austerity plan , which is expected to be announced after Sunday ' s elections but before the international package , to avoid the appearance that the global lender is dictating conditions to Brazil . </s> <s> `` Brazil has to do a lot ,'' Fischer said last week before leaving on his trip . </s> <s> `` In return , I expect the international community will make a large contribution .'' </s> </p> </d> 	abstract=<d> <p> <s> U .

Fox , a professor at the New York University School of Law and an antitrust expert . </s> <s> `` It may be that we are looking at a consolidation on the world level that looked like the consolidation on the national level 100 years ago .'' </s> <s> The Federal Trade Commission recently approved a significant joint venture between Shell and Texaco after the venture agreed to sell a refinery and divest some retailing operations in Hawaii and California . </s> <s> It is also considering the proposed $ 54 billion merger of British Petroleum and Amoco and will now have to re - examine that combination in light of the new talks between Exxon and Mobil . </s> <s> `` In the past , when there have been two mergers involving the same industry , the government has considered them together in deciding how to deal with them ,'' said Terry Calvani , a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission whose clients now include Chevron . </s> <s> But coming in the aftermath of the Shell - Texaco and BP - Amoco deals , a combination of Exxon and Mobil , which have significantly overlapping retail and refinery businesses in the United States and Europe , poses questions that antitrust officials have not confronted since the 1980s . </s> <s> `` It ' s a real test case ,'' said Frederick Leuffer , a senior energy analyst at Bear Stearns . </s> <s> `` If the FTC let this one go through without major divesting , then everything would be fair game . </s> <s> Why couldn ' t GM merge with Ford ?'' </s> <s> While the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil is viewed by Washington officials and industry executives as ancient history , Exxon and Mobil have become the dominant rivals in some retailing and refining markets , and in the production of lubricants and petrochemicals . </s> <s> Leuffer said he believed divestitures necessary in this case `` could be so large that they are deal - breakers .'' </s> <s> Other analysts and lawyers , while disagreeing that the required divestitures could kill the deal , said the companies would nonetheless have to shed significant operations and that they expected challenges to be raised by a broad spectrum of constituents , including competitors , customers and state officials . </s> <s> `` These are not absolute obstacles ,'' said John Hervey , an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin & amp ; Jenrette . </s> <s> In the past , when two big oil companies have merged , aggressive attorneys general from the states have almost always become involved in raising questions because of the high visibility of the local gas station . </s> <s> `` When a state attorney general drives by and sees four stations on a corner and two of them are Mobil and Exxon , they are certain to raise questions ,'' Axinn said . </s> <s> Exxon and Mobil have significant concentrations of retailing and marketing concerns in the Northeast , the Southwest and the West Coast , where they also have big refining operations . </s> <s> Because the two companies are involved in everything from exploration and shipping to refining and retailing , the meaning of the deal for consumers will take months for the regulators to sort out . </s> <s> The regulators examining such a transaction would dissect each business , determine whether its market is global , national or more local , and determine whether the combined entity has too high a concentration of the business in those areas . </s> <s> Experts agreed that the regulators are most likely to permit Exxon and Mobil to keep their exploratory and oil production businesses because those areas are already highly competitive and a merger would not result in higher prices . </s> <s> Hervey said those markets are already so fragmented that the combined market share of major American and European oil companies is only 17 percent . </s> </p> </d> 	abstract=<d> <p> <s> Experts say a possible Exxon - Mobil merger would entail divestitures . </s> </p> </d> 	filename=NYT19981127.0293	publisher=AFP

British Petroleum purchase of Amoco put more pressure on Noto to seek a deal , Hervey said . </s> <s> `` I don ' t think this whole thing would have started if British Petroleum had not pulled the trigger ,'' he said . </s> <s> The British Petroleum - Amoco deal , progressing quickly since the August announcement towards an expected $ 2 billion in annual savings , has put even companies as large as Exxon on the spot . </s> <s> There , Raymond has so far concentrated more on making his operations more efficient than on finding allies . </s> <s> Though Royal Dutch / Shell ' s financial resources are greater than Exxon ' s , some analysts say Exxon still has the size and soundness to absorb a company of Mobil ' s size . </s> <s> Only the largest oil companies can afford to take advantage of today ' s best opportunities . </s> <s> Finding new fields in the deep waters off the coast of West Africa or in the Gulf of Mexico can require platforms costing $ 1 billion or more . </s> <s> Producing oil in the states of the former Soviet Union has taken more time and money than many investors anticipated . </s> <s> In September , Noto was among the American executives invited by a Saudi leader visiting Washington to greatly step up investments in his country , too . </s> <s> Noto spent from 1977 to 1985 in Saudi Arabia himself , building up Mobil operations including a huge refinery . </s> <s> But any new partnerships with the Saudis might require both Mobil ' s connections and Exxon ' s capital . </s> <s> Back when Standard Oil organized its operations by state , Exxon was Standard Oil of New Jersey , while Mobil was Standard Oil of New York . </s> <s> Even after the Standard Oil monopoly was broken up , they remained for several years in the same building in Manhattan . </s> <s> Chernow , the Rockefeller biographer , noted that two pieces of the Standard Oil trust are already likely to be united . </s> <s> British Petroleum bought Standard Oil of Ohio in the 1970s , and Amoco was once Standard Oil of Indiana . </s> <s> The break - up of Standard Oil and the resulting competition has often been cited as a precedent for the current antitrust action against Microsoft . </s> <s> Chernow sees no reason why allowing an Exxon acquisition of Mobil to go through should suggest more leniency for Microsoft . </s> <s> `` Exxon would not be obviously larger than its leading competitors , the way Microsoft is ,'' he said . </s> <s> In the energy business today , he added , `` there are other large dinosaurs that stalk that particular jungle .'' </s> </p> </d> 	abstract=<d> <p> <s> Exxon and Mobil may join because of plunging crude oil prices . </s> </p> </d> 	filename=NYT19981126.0192	publisher=AFP

article=<d> <p> <s> The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday , Oct . 10 : Just days before heading to the United States for critical negotiations with Palestinian leaders , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted the Middle East peace effort with the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israeli foreign minister . </s> <s> The most optimistic reading is that Sharon , long an implacable foe of the Palestinians , is prepared to make peace with them and then sell it to the Israelis who are most opposed . </s> <s> Unfortunately , he is also capable of wrecking the entire peace effort . </s> <s> Much will depend on whether Netanyahu can control his strong - willed aide , a goal that has eluded other Israeli leaders . </s> <s> Like a political typhoon , Sharon has roared across Israeli life for better than three decades as a brilliant military commander , a reckless defense minister and an ardent conservative , often leaving destruction in his wake . </s> <s> He still bears the burden of his role in the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians by Christian militiamen in Lebanon in 1982 . </s> <s> An Israeli inquiry found he was indirectly responsible for the killings at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps . </s> <s> As a leader of the most conservative wing of the Likud party , Sharon can help Netanyahu hold together his shaky Cabinet during potentially decisive negotiations with Yasser Arafat , the Palestinian leader . </s> <s> That will be fine if Sharon is willing to play a constructive role in the peace talks himself . </s> <s> But such behavior is not likely to be the first impulse of a man who has famously said he would never shake hands with Arafat . </s> <s> Since Netanyahu has designated Sharon as his chief negotiator , the new foreign minister will soon have the opportunity to act more responsibly . </s> <s> The first order of business when the two sides get together next week outside Washington is to wrap up negotiations over the further withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank coupled with security guarantees from the Palestinians . </s> <s> Sharon can show statesmanship by helping Netanyahu close this deal , even though it is opposed by the Israeli settlers whose cause Sharon has long championed . </s> <s> Success in these talks would clear the way for the last and most difficult negotiations about a permanent settlement , including the shape and status of a Palestinian state and the future of Jerusalem . </s> <s> If Sharon ever hopes to overcome the shame of Sabra and Shatila , he must become a force for peace in the Middle East . </s> </p> </d> 	abstract=<d> <p> <s> Israeli Foreign Minister Sharon can make or break peace effort </s> </p> </d> 	filename=NYT19981009.0486	publisher=AFP
article=<d> <p> <s> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon , a hawkish former defense minister , to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday in an effort to placate the far right as he moves closer to turning over more West Bank land to the Palestinians . </s> <s> With his appointment , Sharon , 70 , an ardent advocate for Jewish settlements in the West Bank , is expected to quell domestic opposition to the concessions that Netanyahu is supposedly prepared to make at a peace summit conference in the Washington area next week . </s> <s> For months , Sharon , who is currently the minister of national infrastructures , has maintained that redeploying Israeli troops from more than an additional 9 percent of the West Bank would be a `` national disaster .'' </s> <s> In assuming the role of foreign minister , however , he would be forced to abandon his public opposition to Netanyahu ' s decision to withdraw from another 13 percent of the Palestinian territory _ even if he votes against the accord . </s> <s> Sharon will be drawn directly into the issue , since Netanyahu has appointed him to direct the final status talks with the Palestinians , which would follow the signing of an interim peace agreement . </s> <s> Last week Sharon told an Israeli newspaper that , negotiations or not , he would never shake the hand of Yasser Arafat , the Palestinian leader , whom he has long disdained . </s> <s> Palestinian leaders and Israeli leftists were divided in their reactions , in similar ways . </s> <s> Some professed to be aghast , and some , like Nabil Sha ' ath , the Palestinian transportation minister , said they were willing to `` forget history '' if Sharon ' s appointment provided Netanyahu the political backbone to sign a deal . </s> <s> In Washington , White House and State Department officials pledged to work closely with Sharon and emphasized that the personnel in an Israeli government are an internal affair . </s> <s> `` Arik Sharon is the most fitting person in the state of Israel for the position of foreign minister ,'' Netanyahu said , using his nickname . </s> <s> `` He brings with him rich experience , creativity , proven working ability and I think that he well knows both the wounds and damages of war as well as the fruits of peace . </s> <s> `` Sharon has never hidden his beliefs ,'' he continued , `` and his words have influenced the way that the redeployment will be carried out if not its extent .'' </s> <s> In a nod to Sharon , Netanyahu has decided on a new location for the nature reserve that would constitute 3 percent of the West Bank land . </s> <s> It was supposed to be in the Judean desert near Israel ' s eastern border , which Sharon argued would pose a strategic security risk . </s> <s> Instead , it was decided on Thursday that the nature reserve would instead be on the slopes of the Hebron hills , much closer to existing Jewish settlements . </s> <s> Many Israeli political observers believe that Netanyahu has eviscerated his right - wing opposition with this appointment , signaling that he genuinely intends to bring home a peace agreement . </s> <s> `` Who is the right wing now if Sharon is in the foreign ministry and negotiating with the Palestinians ?'' </s> <s> asked Uzi Benziman , an editorial board member of the newspaper Haaretz and author of a critical biography of Sharon . </s> <s> `` It will be just the settlers and some real hard -

negotiations , because he wants to continue to be prime minister at any cost .'' </s> <s> Sharon declined to be interviewed Friday because his appointment must still be approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday , an approval that is expected . </s> <s> An aide , Raanan Gisin , said Sharon accepted the position so that he could `` stem the tide of dangerous developments and contribute to fighting the risks facing Israel .'' </s> <s> A retired general who fought in every Israeli war , Sharon , 70 , is a leading figure of the Likud Party who has done much battle with the Likud prime minister . </s> <s> At the most recent party convention , he said that Netanyahu didn ' t know his right hand from his left , which the prime minister dismissed Friday as a comment made `` in the height of political arguments .'' </s> <s> And when Netanyahu first formed his Cabinet in 1996 , the fact that he did not give Sharon a senior position caused an 11th -

wing political establishment nearly universally applauded the appointment . </s> <s> Uzi Landau , who is a Likud hard - liner , said he was relieved to hear confirmed what has been a rumor for weeks . </s> <s> `` I feel more safe about the negotiations if Minister Sharon is directly involved ,'' said Landau , who heads the Parliament ' s security and foreign affairs committee . </s> <s> `` Undoubtedly it will facilitate the situation for the prime minister to show the right that Arik Sharon is identified with the program , so therefore they can live with it .'' </s> <s> Right before the announcement was made , leaders of the National Religious Party , who had threatened to bring down the government , changed their combative tone . </s> <s> They emerged mollified from meetings with Netanyahu late Thursday , saying they would leave the government intact . </s> <s> Still , they would not connect their change of heart to the nomination of Sharon . </s> <s> `` Appointing Sharon is a political step we like very much ,'' said Shaul Yahalom , the minister of transportation and a leader of the National Religious Party . </s> <s> `` But it will have no effect on how we see the peace agreement . </s> <s> Our concern there is on whether any of the 160 Jewish settlements are endangered .'' </s> <s> The appointment of Sharon comes against a backdrop of violence that has erupted this week . </s> <s> Friday , a 19 -

article=<d> <p> <s> Ariel Sharon has a law degree , and fancies himself a farmer . </s> <s> But for more than three decades his role in Israeli public life has been that of an unapologetic warrior , first on the battlefield and later in the bare -

ager and an infantry commander wounded in the 1948 war of independence , Sharon has fought , and fought memorably , in virtually every major military engagement in his country ' s history . </s> <s> He commanded the legendary armored division that crossed and seized control of the Sinai in the 1967 Arab - Israeli war . </s> <s> He returned to active service after a three - month retirement to lead Israel ' s badly outgunned armored divisions to victory , again in the Sinai , in the war of 1973 . </s> <s> As defense minister in 982 , Sharon led Israel ' s invasion of Lebanon , defying international condemnation with unrelenting artillery assaults on Beirut neighborhoods and Palestinian refugee camps believed by the Israeli high command to be Palestine Liberation Organization redoubts . </s> <s> To some , both in Israel and abroad , Sharon ' s Lebanese incursion will forever be associated with the massacres by Lebanese Christian Phalangists , allies of the Israelis , of a reported 460 unarmed Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps . </s> <s> In an official inquiry in Jerusalem and in a subsequent libel trial he brought in New York , Sharon was seen to have effectively refuted charges that he knew of and condoned the Phalangists ' attacks beforehand . </s> <s> But the government investigating commission held that his failure to prevent the killings constituted grounds for his dismissal from the Defense Ministry . </s> <s> Since the 1982 invasion , Israel has been mired in an unpopular open - ended occupation of southern Lebanon , an operation with constant casualties among young inductees for which Sharon is still often blamed . </s> <s> To many Israelis , however , the Lebanese incursion was ultimately a risk worth taking , as it succeeded in crushing the PLO militarily and driving its forces far from Israel ' s borders . </s> <s> The PLO ' s defeat at Sharon ' s hands in Lebanon led eventually to its renunciation of armed warfare against Israel and embrace of the peace negotiation process for which Sharon as Foreign Minister will now be responsible . </s> <s> In civilian life he proved as savvy a political operator as he was a military strategist , helping to break Labor ' s hold on the Knesset and making himself an indispensable binding force within successive fractious Likud coalitions . </s> <s> His investiture as foreign minister next week will mark his sixth Cabinet appointment in 21 years . </s> <s> He previously held the agriculture and defense portfolios under Prime Minister Menachem Begin , trade and housing in Yitzhak Shamir ' s government , and national infrastructure _ essentially , a settlements support directorate _ in the administration of Benjamin Netanyahu . </s> <s> As a key member of the `` inner cabinet '' in Begin ' s first government , Sharon began the construction and systematic expansion of new Israeli housing developments throughout the West Bank , Gaza Strip and Galilee area territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , a policy that he and his opponents alike would agree remains his signal domestic political achievement . </s> <s> At 70 , Sharon remains one of the great polarizing fixtures of Israeli political life . </s> <s> An acerbic critic of the other leading soldier - politician of his generation , Yitzhak Rabin , Sharon attacked the Oslo peace accords as `` terrible and dangerous '' and condemned Rabin ' s negotiating partner , Yasser Arafat , as a `` war criminal .'' </s> <s> He angrily opposed any diplomatic discussions of the return of even an internationally demilitarized Golan Heights to Syria . </s> <s> A secular Jew in the manner typical of his generation of native - born Israelis , Sharon became an outspoken and effective defender of new Orthodox Jewish settlements in the predominantly Palestinian areas of the West Bank , cementing his position as a bridge between the traditional secular right and the new militant religious factions within the Likud coalition . </s> </p> </d> 	abstract=<d> <p> <s> Ariel Sharon , new Israeli foreign minister , is pugnacious to a fault </s> </p> </d> 	filename=NYT19981009.0337	publisher=AFP

article=<d> <p> <s> Jose Saramago , a 75 - year - old Portuguese writer who took up literature relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novels soon won him a following of loyal readers across Europe and vocal admirers in the United States , was awarded this year ' s Nobel Prize in Literature Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm . </s> <s> A tall , balding man whose large , tinted glasses often give him a mien of severity , Saramago is the first Portuguese - language writer _ and one of the first card - carrying Communists _ to become a Nobel Literature laureate . </s> <s> He is also the fourth successive European to win the prize , after Italy ' s Dario Fo in 1997 , Poland ' s Wislawa Szymborska in 1996 and Ireland ' s Seamus Heaney in 1995 . </s> <s> In its citation Thursday , the Swedish Academy praised Saramago `` who with parables sustained by imagination , compassion and irony continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality .'' </s> <s> Although Saramago discounts the influence of Latin American `` magical realism '' on his work , his novels often use the supernatural , allegorical , paradoxical and irrational as ways of addressing complex questions of faith and existence . </s> <s> Many of his novels are set against a backdrop of political or historical events , but it is his unwavering concern for individual fate that gives his fiction its distinctive voice and independent character . </s> <s> His best - known books , all published in the United States , are `` Baltasar and Blimunda ,'' `` The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis ,'' `` The Stone Raft '' and `` The History of the Siege of Lisbon .'' </s> <s> His latest book available in English , `` Blindness ,'' in which all but one of his characters mysteriously become blind , was described as his `` symphonic new novel '' by Andrew Miller in The New York Times Book Review on Sunday . </s> <s> `` There is no cynicism and there are no conclusions , just a clear - eyed and compassionate acknowledgment of things as they are , a quality than can only honestly be termed as wisdom ,'' Miller , himself a novelist , wrote . </s> <s> `` We should be grateful when it is handed to us in such generous measures .'' </s> <s> Saramago learned of his award Thursday at Frankfurt airport , where he was preparing to fly home via Madrid to Lanzarote in the Canary Islands after attending the Frankfurt Book Fair . </s> <s> Earlier this week , he participated in a round - table of Portuguese writers on the topic , `` Why I am still a Communist .'' </s> <s> He immediately returned to the fair where he was received with cheers and bouquets of roses . </s> <s> `` I am personally very happy for myself ,'' he said . </s> <s> `` I am also happy for my country .'' </s> <s> Later he told a news conference : `` The Portuguese language had to wait 100 years for this . </s> <s> There have to be ways and means of protecting the language so that it does not become a museum , but is something that is alive . </s> <s> The writer ' s role is to protect it and work with it .'' </s> <s> The award was also celebrated in Lisbon , where President Jorge Sampaio described it as `` recognition of Portuguese culture ,'' while the local Communist leader , Carlos Carvalho , saw it as a credit to his own party . </s> <s> `` As a member of our party ,'' he noted solemnly , `` Saramago makes a great contribution to our ideals and to the struggle for social change .'' </s> <s> The laureate ' s fiction , though , is never overtly political . </s> <s> Saramago , whose body of work includes poetry , essays , plays and a journal as well as 10 novels , is unusual for having emerged as a major literary figure only at the age of 60 . </s> <s> His novels have since been translated into 30 languages , selling particularly well in Portugal , Brazil , Spain , Italy and Germany . </s> <s> While he has not been well known in the United States , his novels have always been critically well received there . </s> <s> For all his late blooming , though , Saramago long dreamed of becoming a writer . </s> <s> Born into a family of rural laborers and raised in Lisbon , he was forced by poverty to leave school while a teen - ager and learn the trade of car mechanic . </s> <s> Yet he managed to publish a small novel at the age of 25 . </s> <s> Later , he found work at a Lisbon publishing company , but the oppressive and censorial atmosphere of the Salazar dictatorship discouraged him from writing . </s> <s> It was only after Portugal ' s April 1974 revolution that Saramago felt free to find his voice . </s> <s> A member of the Portuguese Communist Party since 1969 , he served as editor of a Lisbon newspaper , Diario de Noticias , during an 18 - month period when the left looked likely to seize power in Portugal . </s> <s> But an anti - Communist backlash in November 1975 forced him out of the newspaper and he began translating French texts into Portuguese to make ends meet . </s> <s> In the late 1970s , he also turned to novels , publishing three in succession in 1977 , 1978 and 1980 . </s> <s> But it was in 1982 , with `` Baltasar and Blimunda '' (`` Memorial do Convento '' in Portuguese ), that he achieved his international breakthrough . </s> <s> `` This is a rich , multifaceted and polysemous text that at the same time has a historical , a social and an individual perspective ,'' the Swedish Academy noted Thursday . </s> <s> `` The insight and wealth of imagination to which it gives expression is characteristic of Saramago ' s work as a whole .'' </s> <s> Set in 18th - century Portugal during the Inquisition , the book tells of the baroque efforts of a war veteran , Baltasar , and a visionary , Blimunda , to escape to the heavens aboard a flying machine powered by human wills captured by the hypersensory Blimunda . </s> <s> This fantastic story takes place against the very real background of the tortuous construction of the massive Mafra Convent by thousands of men held in the grip of the Inquisition . </s> <s> When the novel was published in the United States in 1987 , Irving Howe acclaimed it as `` brilliant '' in The New York Times Book Review . </s> <s> `` Mr . Saramago is constantly present as a voice of European skepticism , a connoisseur of ironies ,'' Howe wrote . </s> <s> `` I think I hear in his prose echoes of Enlightenment sensibility , caustic and shrewd .'' </s> <s> In his next novel , `` The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis ,'' which is also a homage to the great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa , who appears in it as a ghost , Saramago sets his story in the early years of the Salazar dictatorship , with the tale following the romantic and sexual misadventures of a poet - physician . </s> <s> Writing in The New York Times , Herbert Mitgang called it `` a rare , old - fashioned novel _ at once lyrical , symbolic and meditative .'' </s> <s> Saramago , whose sense of literary freedom is evident in his unconventional punctuation and conflicting use of tenses , sought a different form of freedom in `` The Stone Raft ,'' where he imagines the confusion unleashed when the Iberian peninsula suddenly breaks free from the rest of Europe and begins drifting toward the New World and threatens to collide with the Azores . </s> <s> To the delight of Britons , Gibraltar is left behind . </s> <s> Unsurprisingly , the bitter satire , `` The Gospel According to Jesus Christ ,'' proved controversial , with God shown as using the innocently human Jesus to create a religion that has spawned violence and intolerance . </s> <s> When a Lisbon jury picked the book as Portugal ' s entry for a 1992 European literary prize , the country ' s conservative government vetoed the choice as blasphemous . </s> <s> It was then that Saramago decided to leave his small , crowded apartment in Lisbon for the relative solitude of Lanzarote . </s> <s> `` The History of the Siege of Lisbon ,'' published in the United States last year , is a whimsical tale set in motion by the decision of a humble proofreader at a publishing house to insert the word `` not '' into a key passage in a standard history of Portugal . </s> <s> With this `` lunatic creative act ,'' as Edmund White put it in The New York Times Book Review , he `` totally derails the national saga '' by affirming that the crusaders did not in fact help liberate 12th - century Lisbon from Moorish occupation . </s> <s> White ended his July 1997 review with a prescient remark . </s> <s> `` Word has it that Saramago is overdue for a Nobel Prize ,'' he noted . </s> <s> `` No candidate has a better claim to lasting recognition than this novelist .'' </s> <s> With the recent publication of `` Blindness '' in the United States , only Saramago ' s latest novel , `` Todos os Nomes ,'' or `` All the Names '' still awaits translation into English . </s> <s> In the tradition of Andre Gide and Julian Green , though , he has now embarked on his journals . </s> <s> The fourth volume of these `` Cadernos de Lanzarote '' was just published in Lisbon . </s> <s> Saramago will receive his Nobel Prize , worth the equivalent of $ 967 , 500 this year , at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec . 10 . </s> </p> </d> 	abstract=<d> <p> <s> Jose Saramago - first Portuguese to win Nobel Prize in Literature </s> </p> </d> 	filename=NYT19981008.0338	publisher=AFP

D . economists . </s> <s> There are few officials with deep experience in international politics , much less the complexities of Javanese culture that were at work in Indonesia . </s> <s> Historically , experts in politics and security have gravitated to the United Nations , development experts to the World Bank , and economists to the IMF _ creating dangerous gaps in a crisis like this one . </s> <s> As a result , the fund had only a rudimentary understanding of what would happen if its demands were met and all Indonesia ' s state monopolies were quickly dissolved . </s> <s> While that system lined the pockets of the Suhartos and their friends , it also distributed food , gasoline and other staples to a country that stretches for 3 , 000 miles over thousands of islands . </s> <s> To help balance the budget , the fund demanded a quick end to expensive subsidies that keep the price of food and gasoline artificially low . </s> <s> But that , combined with the huge currency devaluation that sparked the crisis , resulted in high prices and shortages that fueled riots that continue to this day , as millions of Indonesians lose their jobs . </s> <s> The IMF _ unintentionally , its officials insist _ also sped Suharto ' s resignation , insisting on the elimination of `` crony capitalism ,'' code words for removing the Suharto family from the center of the economy . </s> <s> Ultimately , that may prove to be Indonesia ' s salvation , if the new government can contain the rioting against the ethnic Chinese minority _ whose money is desperately needed to save the country ' s fast - shrinking economy . </s> <s> `` It is worth noting ,'' Fischer said this week , `` that our programs in Asia _ in Indonesia , Korea and Thailand _ only took hold after there was a change in government .'' </s> <s> Nonetheless , the Indonesia experience has revived the argument that the IMF is so focused on stabilizing banks and currencies , on preventing capital flight and freeing up markets , that it is blind to the social costs of its actions . </s> <s> Among the toughest critics has been its sister institution , the World Bank , whose main charge is alleviating poverty . </s> <s> `` You ' ve seen the tension almost every day ,'' one senior World Bank official said recently . </s> <s> The bank has gone to extraordinary lengths in recent months to differentiate its role from that of the fund , and to announce a tripling of aid to the poorest in the countries hit by the economic chaos . </s> <s> Even U . N . Secretary General Kofi Annan has joined the argument , warning in a speech at Harvard recently that `` if globalization is to succeed , it must succeed for poor and rich alike . </s> <s> It must deliver rights no less than riches . </s> <s> It must be harnessed to the cause not of capital alone , but of development and prosperity for the poorest of the world .'' </s> <s> IMF officials say they are changing strategies when they see they are exacting too great a social cost . </s> <s> `` It ' s a very difficult formula to get exactly right ,'' Fischer said in August , as Russia was teetering and the IMF was sending in $ 4 . 8 billion in aid that was rapidly wasted . </s> <s> `` You need enough discipline to send the right message to the markets and keep investors from fleeing . </s> <s> But you need enough leeway to keep people from suffering more than they otherwise would .'' </s> <s> In recent months , he noted , the IMF has allowed more spending to sustain subsidies for basic goods for longer periods in Indonesia , Korea and elsewhere . </s> <s> `` There is a new flexibility at the IMF '' a senior Indonesian official concluded recently . </s> <s> `` It is a lot better .'' </s> <s> A U .

S . Treasury ' s lap dog . </s> <s> Ask in Jakarta or Moscow , and the response is the same : The IMF never ventures far without looking back for the approving nod of its master . </s> <s> When the United States weighs in , however , is when the IMF is called on to rescue a country in deep trouble . </s> <s> Only then does the IMF _ and the U .

S . ally , as a sign of support and confidence . </s> <s> Mindful of the backlash in Congress when Mexico was bailed out with U . S . money , that was the last thing the Treasury planned to do . </s> <s> Summers , in turn , thought the fund was not forcing the Thais to implement its reform commitments rigorously enough or disclose their true financial picture . </s> <s> Within the U . S . government there was other dissension : The State and Defense Departments felt the United States should do more for Thailand , but backed off when the Treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their own budgets . </s> <s> There were other conflicts . </s> <s> When Japan used the last IMF meeting to propose setting up a $ 100 billion `` Asia Fund '' _ one that would exclude the United States and would probably offer aid under much more relaxed conditions than the IMF does . </s> <s> Rubin called up Camdessus at breakfast one morning and told him that the Japanese proposal would undercut the IMF ' s authority . </s> <s> `` We ' ve just had a dispute with Michel ,'' Rubin reported to his aides as he returned to his orange juice and croissant . </s> <s> One of them shot back : `` And it ' s only 8 a . m .'' Camdessus backed down at Rubin ' s insistence and walked away from money that Asia could have used . </s> <s> Japan says it will be back with a similar proposal this weekend , this time for a $ 30 billion fund . </s> <s> Camdessus has also rankled U . S . officials with statements that amounted to cheerleading to reassure the markets _ sometimes in the face of the facts . </s> <s> In June , with Russia on its way to collapse , Camdessus declared that `` contrary to what markets and commentators are imagining '' about the slow collapse of Russia ' s economy , `` this is not a crisis . </s> <s> This is not a major development .'' </s> <s> The bailouts of Russia and South Korea were prime examples of how Washington muscles into the IMF ' s turf as soon as major U . S . strategic interests are involved . </s> <s> Last Christmas , as South Korea slipped within days of running out of hard currency to pay its debts in December , it sent a secret envoy , Kim Kihwan , to work out a rescue package . </s> <s> `` I didn ' t bother going to the IMF ,'' Kim recalled recently . </s> <s> `` I called Summers ' office at the Treasury from my home in Seoul , flew to Washington and went directly there . </s> <s> I knew that was how this would get done .'' </s> <s> Within days the Treasury dispatched David Lipton , its most experienced veteran of emergency bailouts , who is leaving his post as undersecretary for international affairs this month , to shadow the IMF staff ' s negotiations with the government in Seoul . </s> <s> Fischer was displeased . </s> <s> `` To make a negotiation effective , it has to be clear who has the authority to do the negotiating ,'' he said . </s> <s> WHO LOST RUSSIA ? </s> <s> The pattern was repeated this summer , when the United States raced to put together a $ 17 billion package for Russia . </s> <s> The IMF ' s staff in Moscow declared that Russia needed no money at all _ it just needed to enact policies that would restore confidence in investors . </s> <s> The Americans and Germans came to a different conclusion . </s> <s> Soon after , U . S . officials gathered in the White House situation room to consider what might happen to Russia if the ruble was devalued and market reforms collapsed and to push the IMF to come up with emergency money . </s> <s> So the fund began assembling a last - ditch program to prop up a country that had resisted its reform plans for seven years . </s> <s> Camdessus , though , was still hesitant , questioning whether the IMF should risk its scarce resources in Russia . </s> <s> `` We had to pull Michel along ,'' a senior Treasury official recalled . </s> <s> As it turned out , Camdessus ' instincts were right while the approach championed by Rubin and Summers proved disastrously wrong . </s> <s> The first installment of that payment _ $ 4 . 8 billion _ was wasted , propping up the currency long enough , in the words of one IMF official , `` to let the oligarchs get their money out of the country .'' </s> <s> Then Yeltsin reversed his commitments , let the ruble devalue anyway , began printing money with abandon and fired virtually every reformer in his government _ resulting in a collapse of the IMF agreements and the indefinite suspension of its aid program . </s> <s> Now , inside the IMF and on Capitol Hill , there are recriminations over `` who lost Russia .'' </s> <s> Publicly , Fischer argues that `` there are no apologies owed for what we attempted in Russia .'' </s> <s> But some IMF officials complain privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod over them , striking a deal that fell apart within weeks as the Russian parliament rebelled and Yeltsin backed away from his commitments . </s> <s> Summers responds that the United States `` took a calculated risk '' because `` it was vastly better that Russia succeed than not succeed .'' </s> <s> The Russian collapse touched off new rounds of economic contagion , with investors fleeing Latin America , and triggering huge losses in hedge funds like Long Term Capital , the Greenwich , Conn ., investment firm that needed to be rescued by Wall Street powerhouses whose money it had invested . </s> <s> `` Russia was a turning point ,'' said Robert Hormats , the vice chairman of Goldman , Sachs & amp ; Co . `` It made the world realize that some countries can fail , even if the IMF and the Treasury intercede . </s> <s> And that changed the perception of risk .'' </s> <s> Now , as the countries meet to face a future that the IMF has warned could be very bleak , they need to reverse those perceptions , or watch countries slowly starve for lack of capital . </s> <s> The emerging markets are calling for controls on short term investments . </s> <s> The French want a stronger IMF . </s> <s> The Americans say the answer is more disclosure , so that investors are better warned , and tougher regulation . </s> <s> `` These are usually nice , quiet meetings ; everyone very polite ,'' a top U .

Matt Salmon , R - Ariz ., said : `` I personally have made the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in January , and there are six others who have told me they feel the same way , seven people who just will not , and it takes six to deadlock the vote .'' </s> <s> Fury at the speaker has boiled over since Tuesday ' s elections , when Republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the House . </s> <s> They blamed Gingrich , the party ' s chief strategist . </s> <s> But many were already angry at him for what they said was his failure to articulate a clear message for the party going into the elections and for a messy budget process that gave President Clinton a political edge and contradicted Republican principles of fiscal conservativism by containing massive amounts of pork spending . </s> <s> House Republicans are to meet Nov . 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leaders . </s> <s> Whoever wins the party ' s nomination for speaker then stands for election by the full House in January . </s> <s> Even if Gingrich wins the secret ballot , he could be denied re - election as speaker in January if Salmon and at least five others refuse to vote for him . </s> <s> Because the Republicans now control the House by only 12 seats , it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him a majority and allow Democrats to potentially elect one of their own as speaker . </s> <s> With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming , Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside for the good of the party , according to Republican officials . </s> <s> The officials said that Livingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the disastrous election returns but also before the election , reflecting Livingston ' s earlier displeasure with the speaker over the budget process . </s> <s> Several Republicans said that both Livingston , the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker , and Gingrich were working the phones on Thursday in a struggle for votes . </s> <s> Livingston has said nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich , but several members and aides said on Thursday that he would announce his intentions , possibly as soon as Friday , after he had determined if he could win . </s> <s> `` He won ' t do it ' til he has his ducks in a row , and right now a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker ,'' said an aide to a Republican who , like many others , is trying to straddle the line between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement to a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party . </s> </p> </d> 	abstract=<d> <p> <s> Livingston gains support in challenge to Gingrich for House speaker </s> </p> </d> 	filename=NYT19981105.0439	publisher=AFP

article=<d> <p> <s> The presidential campaign of 2000 began Wednesday , like it or not . </s> <s> The millennial election will be fought on a political playing field whose rough outlines , if not its exact boundaries , were drawn by the voters in Tuesday ' s elections , which delivered a crushing disappointment to the giddy hopes of the Republicans and an unexpected elixir to the recently ailing Democrats . </s> <s> President Clinton called it an `` astonishing '' triumph of issues over investigations and said the Democrats had won so many major victories `` because they had a clear message .'' </s> <s> Republicans agreed . </s> <s> Of course the next 18 months will bring many surprises and many reversals of fortune . </s> <s> But the election results offered important guidelines . </s> <s> Tuesday was a great day for Vice President Al Gore , for at least three reasons . </s> <s> He worked furiously and successfully in the last ten days before the balloting to persuade Democratic loyalists not to stay home and sulk , appearing on behalf of no fewer than 224 candidates , according to his office . </s> <s> A moderate within the spectrum of his own party , he watched moderates win crucial elections , notably in the California gubernatorial race , where Lt .

article=<d> <p> <s> More than five years of severe food shortages and a near - total breakdown in the public health system have led to devastating malnutrition in North Korea and probably left an entire generation of children physically and mentally impaired , a new study by international aid groups has found . </s> <s> The study , the first scientific nutritional survey in North Korea , confirms the disturbing reports by international aid workers , who over the past year have gained increasing access to the population of this highly isolated and secretive country . </s> <s> Among other shocking findings , researchers from the World Food Program , Unicef and the European Union found that , because of long - term food shortages , a staggering 62 percent of children under 7 years old suffer from stunted growth . </s> <s> They have discovered that , despite a huge international food aid program over the past three years , severe malnutrition is widespread among toddlers at crucial stages of brain development , suggesting that this generation ' s physical and mental abilities will not develop normally and that the losses can never be recovered . </s> <s> Separately , international medical workers from groups like the Red Cross , have begun to document how the effects of food shortages are being severely compounded by a breakdown in public health services . </s> <s> Even basic water purification systems stand idle for lack of essential ingredients like chlorine , Red Cross workers say , leaving vast numbers of people with such severe diarrhea that they are unable to absorb completely what little food they have . </s> <s> As the North Korean dictatorship has slowly , often grudgingly , granted increased access to international aid groups in the last six months , an increasingly clear and saddening picture of the hunger haas emerged as a result of the large formal study and informal surveys and observations by foreign aid agencies . </s> <s> Past assessments of the magnitude of the disaster in the country of 23 million are considered flawed because they were based on interviews with a small number of North Korean refugees who had fled into China . </s> <s> And while the researchers and aid workers on the ground in North Korea have not seen evidence of cannibalism or starving children dying by the roadside _ descriptions that have surfaced in the more lurid refugee reports _ what they did find was in many ways equally disturbing : A population withering after nearly a decade of chronic hunger , people so weakened by malnutrition that colds and stomach flus quickly turn lethal , the future of a generation irretrievably lost . </s> <s> `` Now at last we have hard facts _ the situation is very grave ,'' said Judith Cheng - Hopkins , regional director for Asia of the World Food Program , which has taken part in the research . </s> <s> `` To me this is a famine in slow motion . </s> <s> People cope year after year , and probably a lot drop off . </s> <s> But the totality is very hard to gauge .'' </s> <s> For three weeks this fall , crews led by foreign scientists were finally permitted to fan out across North Korea to conduct the first random sample nutritional survey of children , providing by far the most solid data on the crisis . </s> <s> They found that 62 percent of children under 7 had stunted growth , a symptom of long - term malnutrition . </s> <s> Thirty percent of 1 - year - olds suffered from moderate to severe malnutrition . </s> <s> This means a high likelihood of impaired mental and physical development , because the nervous system matures dramatically during this essential first year . </s> <s> The researchers said that available scientific data suggest that 10 years ago , malnutrition was rare in North Korea . </s> <s> `` Even if the situation improves , it is unlikely to improve to the degree that the country will fully recover from what we saw ,'' said Judit Katona - Apte , a senior program adviser for the World Food Program . </s> <s> `` People will be small and not as well developed as otherwise and somewhat limited in their mental capacities .'' </s> <s> Likewise , when Red Cross representatives this year tested the water supply at the 840 hospitals and clinics where they operate , they found that not one had water that was suitable for human consumption , said Sten Swedlund , head of the Red Cross delegation in North Korea . </s> <s> `` But of course they drink it _ they have no choice ,'' he said during a recent trip to Beijing . </s> <s> `` There is a very close relationship between the problems caused by the lack of food and a health sector that ' s in very bad shape .'' </s> <s> Virtually all the children under 7 who are malnourished also have diarrhea , he said . </s> <s> None of the aid groups has been able to study the issue of hunger - related deaths , and the North Koreans have not released relevant figures , although most experts agree that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three million have died prematurely since the food shortages began . </s> <s> But public health experts say the number who have perished might be difficult to tally in any case , because most deaths were probably not from quick starvation , but from immune systems weakened by years of hunger , so that common colds more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an ordinary bout of infectious diarrhea proves fatal . </s> <s> Still , there are some disturbing clues : In one limited study conducted by the World Food Program and other groups last year on 4 , 000 children hand - picked by the government , 10 percent had a parent who was dead . </s> <s> In this fall ' s independent nutritional survey , 18 teams of experts sent to eight of North Korea ' s nine provinces looked at 1 , 800 rural and urban children under seven . </s> <s> In addition to finding that 62 percent of children had stunted growth , the teams found that about 16 percent of children were suffering from acute malnutrition and were underweight for their height , a sign that they were severely underfed at the time of the study . </s> <s> That figure is higher than in any country in East Asia and puts North Korea among the world ' s worst 10 countries in terms of malnutrition . </s> <s> While that 16 percent figure is not quite as bad as that of India and Bangladesh , the worst in the world with an 18 percent malnutrition rate , experts say that North Korea ' s number in some ways understates the problem . </s> <s> In India and Bangladesh , pockets of severe poverty alternate with pockets of relative plenty , while in North Korea the whole country is to some degree underfed . </s> <s> `` Even in war - torn countries , famine is more in pockets ,'' Dr . Katona - Apte said . </s> <s> `` It ' s hard to think of another country that ' s been affected in this way .'' </s> <s> The survey results are especially sobering since the researchers studied only children under 7 , the group that received nearly all the food donated from abroad . </s> <s> After three years of food donations , many foreign aid workers in the country have remarked that children in nurseries and kindergartens are looking better _ but that their older siblings are failing . </s> <s> So a month ago , the World Food Program began providing elementary schools with high nutrition biscuits for children aged 7 to 12 . </s> <s> `` We have reason to believe that many people are suffering and that the elderly are a neglected age group that is just getting weaker and weaker ,'' Swedlund said . </s> <s> There are now more than 100 Westerners living in Pyongyang , the capital city , and many say the long - term hunger is readily apparent there . </s> <s> `` If you walk down the street in Pyongyang and ask a child how old she is , you are usually off by three years ,'' Swedlund said . </s> <s> `` She may be 7 but she looks just 3 or 4 .'' </s> <s> Dr . Katona - Apte , a nutrition expert who has worked in Bangladesh and the Sudan , said she was shocked when she first visited a North Korean kindergarten last year . </s> <s> `` There were these two children sitting at a desk who were obviously severely malnourished _ they were so thin and they had patchy hair ,'' she said . </s> <s> `` And they were just sitting there working . </s> <s> This is accepted as normal ! </s> <s> They are in school , and they should really be hospitalized or placed in nutritional rehabilitation . </s> <s> If you saw them in a refugee camp , you would recommend immediate intervention .'' </s> <s> But with a severely depleted public health and hospital system , that option does not exist , she and others said . </s> <s> Many Korean doctors do not know how to diagnose or treat malnutrition ; few had seen it before this decade . </s> <s> And , in any case , the hospitals lack the food and proper nutritional supplements . </s> <s> Swedlund said most hospitals lacked medicines , had no glass to replace broken windows and were `` colder inside than out ,'' having received no coal since 1994 . </s> <s> He said that even in hospitals , sanitation and water purification systems were virtually nonexistent , because the country lacks chlorine for purification and fuel to run water pumps . </s> <s> He said that next year , the Red Cross would start to address those problems , spending $ 3 . 5 on food for hospital patients and $ 1 million on water treatment . </s> <s> With few other options , vast numbers of North Koreans have resorted to eating `` substitute food ,'' hard cakes and noodles made from a mix of nutritional plants , like soybeans and sweet potatoes , combined with indigestible filler , like cornstalks and straw . </s> <s> `` This now constitutes 40 percent of food intake ,'' Swedlund said . </s> <s> `` It ' s becoming a regular part of the food basket .'' </s> <s> Doctors in North Korea say many people suffer from stomachaches after eating this partly indigestible material , he said , but added , `` If you ' re very hungry , it fills your stomach .'' </s> <s> Although the North Koreans date their food problems to a series of floods and droughts in the mid - 1990 ' s , the foreign researchers who have worked in North Korea say medical records and childhood growth patterns indicate that the hunger began several years before that and is linked to the collapse of the Soviet Union , which had long been North Korea ' s main supplier of food , fuel and fertilizer . </s> <s> North Korea is a mountainous country , with less than 20 percent arable land . </s> <s> It has been a food importer for decades , mostly from the former Soviet Union , but also from China . </s> <s> `` The country has to come to grips with the fact that this is part of a structural problem and can ' t just be blamed on the weather anymore ,'' Ms . Cheng - Hopkins said . </s> <s> Still , she and others praised the normally rigid and secretive government for slowly loosening its restrictions . </s> <s> Swedlund said that after three years in the country , the international Red Cross , which collaborates with the North Korean Red Cross , had found officials increasingly responsive and doctors more willing to share medical records and bring up problems . </s> <s> Travel is still restricted . </s> <s> There are more than 100 counties , home to 30 percent of the population , to which aid groups have no access and where they have therefore refused to provide food or medical supplies . </s> <s> Still , the number of counties open to the workers has increased steadily , and freedom to move about has improved . </s> <s> Ms .

styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders in the province ' s western town of Junik but then broke off all contact . </s> <s> Clinton administration officials said at the time that they were concerned that NATO intervention would bolster the separatist forces . </s> <s> To try to put the best face on the situation , Washington worked with Moscow to get Milosevic to accept the presence of international monitors who would patrol Kosovo and report on military action . </s> <s> The monitors were slow in getting organized . </s> <s> By August , when the Yugoslav army , backed by the Serbian special police , were in full swing against the rebels and burning and looting villages in the process , the monitors found it difficult to gain access to the fighting . </s> <s> They drove up to roadblocks , knew something was going on from the sounds and the smoke , but could not be precise . </s> <s> In recent days as the tanks and artillery have withdrawn , access has improved , the monitors say . </s> <s> But there are some areas in central Kosovo around Likovac and Gornje Obrinje that the monitors have ruled off limits because of land mines on the roads . </s> <s> The mines are believed to have been planted by the guerrillas . </s> <s> Gornje Obrinje was the site of a massacre of 18 ethnic Albanian women , children and elderly people on Sept . 26 . </s> <s> A British reporter who walked across fields into the village on Sunday said about 10 mortar shells , apparently from the Serbian police or the Yugoslav army , were fired at the village early Sunday afternoon . </s> <s> The Yugoslav army and police forces have been responsible for the vast majority of atrocities in the Kosovo conflict , said a report by New York - based group Human Rights Watch , released here on Sunday . </s> <s> The report said the rebels had also violated the laws of war by taking civilian hostages and carrying out summary executions . </s> <s> But the violations by the guerrillas were on a `` lesser scale '' than the government abuses , the author of the report , Fred Abrahams , concluded . </s> <s> The report focused on what it called a watershed in the conflict _ the attack by police forces on three ethnic Albanian villages in late February and early March in the Drenica region of central Kosovo . </s> <s> At least 83 people , including 24 women and children , were killed in the attack , which involved helicopters , artillery and armored personnel carriers . </s> <s> In the Yugoslav capital , Belgrade , which is a four - hour drive north through rolling countryside from Kosovo ' s capital of Pristina , Milosevic remains politically secure . </s> <s> That is in part , his domestic critics say , because diplomats like Holbrooke and the head of the U .

article=<d> <p> <s> In little more than a week , the world ' s leaders will converge on this businesslike city in the heart of Southeast Asia for the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum . </s> <s> They could hardly be meeting in a more provocative place . </s> <s> On Sept . 1 , Malaysia discontinued trading in its currency , the ringgit , and imposed sweeping controls on the flow of capital in its stock and currency markets , particularly on investment from overseas . </s> <s> In doing so , the Malaysian prime minister , Mahathir Mohamad , in effect slammed the door on the global economy that President Clinton and the other leaders are coming here to champion . </s> <s> Mahathir ' s decision drew jeers from international investors and policy - makers , who warned that Malaysia was seeking a quick fix that would retard its desperately needed reforms and leave it the odd man out when Asia finally recovered from the regional malaise . </s> <s> Now , though , Mahathir ' s allies are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate that capital controls are breathing new life into the country ' s moribund economy . </s> <s> Malaysia ' s foreign reserves rose strongly in September , and there is anecdotal evidence that consumers are starting to spend again . </s> <s> `` It ' s nice to be able to say that since we adopted capital controls , the economy has improved ,'' said Zainal Aznam Yusof , the deputy director of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies , a research organization here that helped draft the policies . </s> <s> `` But we want to see whether this is strongly sustainable .'' </s> <s> Critics said it was predictable that capital controls would be a short - term tonic to Malaysia ' s economy . </s> <s> Because the country is sheltered from the vagaries of capital flows and currency fluctuations , they said , the government had been able to ease interest rates and encourage consumer spending . </s> <s> Still , the mere fact that Malaysia ' s experiment has yielded some positive results guarantees that the issue will come up during the APEC meeting . </s> <s> With Mahathir leading the campaign , the cause of capital controls will have a fiery advocate who has a penchant for getting under the skin of Westerners . </s> <s> `` Mahathir is a very outspoken political leader ,'' said Chia Yew Boon , an independent analyst in Singapore . </s> <s> `` There is no way the likes of Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going to be able to muzzle him ,'' he added , referring to President Jiang of China . </s> <s> Policy - makers in the United States have expressed fears that if Malaysia ' s gambit is seen as successful , other economically weakened countries in the region , like Indonesia , might be tempted to try it . </s> <s> So far , Indonesian officials have said they would stick to the recovery plan devised by the International Monetary Fund , which stresses economic austerity and open markets . </s> <s> But officials in Japan have expressed some sympathy for Mahathir ' s policies , while Paul Krugman , an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , has advocated using them as an emergency measure . </s> <s> Yusof said recent events had vindicated Malaysia ' s contention that it needed to insulate itself from the ravages of the global financial system . </s> <s> He said the recent near - collapse of a prominent American hedge fund underscored how sudden flows of capital can have destructive consequences . </s> <s> The Long - Term Capital Management hedge fund , based in Greenwich , Conn ., was nearly wrecked by a series of wrong bets on Treasury securities after the collapse of the economy in Russia prompted a flight of capital out of that country . </s> <s> `` The LTCM fiasco really provides a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy ,'' Yusof said . </s> <s> With capital controls as protection , Yusof said Malaysia was picking up the pieces of its shattered economy . </s> <s> In addition to growing foreign reserves , he said Malaysia had improved its trade balance and revived consumer purchases of durable goods . </s> <s> Foreign investors have also not wholly abandoned Malaysia , as experts had predicted they would . </s> <s> While foreign direct investment fell in September _ to $ 142 million , from an average monthly rate of $ 321 million for the period from January through September _ it did not dry up completely . </s> <s> For every comforting statistic , though , the critics produce an alarming one . </s> <s> They said the increase in Malaysia ' s foreign reserves was merely due to the new capital restrictions , which stipulated that Malaysian currency held outside the country would be worthless unless repatriated by Sept . 30 . </s> <s> The skeptics also noted that bank lending declined in September , despite several reductions in interest rates . </s> <s> So the consumers who are buying new cars and home appliances are merely dipping into their savings , which means the buying spree will end when their savings are depleted . </s> <s> `` The argument was that by imposing capital controls , you ' d regain control over monetary policy , which would increase the supply of money and lessen the liquidity crunch ,'' said K . S . </s> <s> Jomo , a professor of political economy at the University of Malaya here . </s> <s> `` But that ' s not happening .'' </s> <s> The biggest flaw in Malaysia ' s policy , Jomo and others said , is its timing . </s> <s> With the Asian crisis more than a year old , much of the foreign capital that was in the country has already gone . </s> <s> The critics said Mahathir had spooked would - be investors without even locking in the ones who used to be here . </s> <s> `` There is a case to be made for the temporary imposition of capital controls , but to avert a crisis , not to respond to one ,'' Jomo said . </s> <s> In fact , other Asian currencies , like the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht , have actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended trading in its currency and fixed the exchange rate at 3 . 8 ringgit to the dollar . </s> <s> Analysts liken the situation to buying an insurance policy for a disaster that has come and gone . </s> <s> More important , the capital controls are slowing down much - needed corporate and banking reforms . </s> <s> The government ' s rescue of Renong , a major conglomerate with close ties to Mahathir , is going ahead , though some analysts predict the government will eventually scrap the much - criticized plan . </s> <s> The rescue of politically connected companies remains a tense issue here . </s> <s> On Monday , during the trial of Malaysia ' s former deputy prime minister , Anwar Ibrahim , on charges of corruption and sex - related crimes , Anwar angrily denied Mahathir ' s claim that he had approved the bailout . </s> <s> Anwar ' s sensational trial is a reminder that Mahathir ' s economic policies cannot be disentangled from politics . </s> <s> Malaysia ' s 72 - year - old prime minister clashed with his former protege over how to respond to the Asian crisis , and he dismissed Anwar the day after imposing capital controls . </s> <s> During boom times , Mahathir won support for his policies by wrapping them in anti - foreigner language . </s> <s> In a speech on Monday , he attacked a familiar target , saying foreign currency traders `` are the cause of the currency turmoil ,'' adding : `` They spread it worldwide . </s> <s> They precipitated the current recession in every country .'' </s> <s> But Mahathir ' s treatment of Anwar has stirred anger and sparked growing social unrest in Malaysia . </s> <s> With protesters chanting for reform on the usually orderly streets of this city , experts said Mahathir needed capital controls to work in order to soothe the country ' s agitated population . </s> <s> `` Things will heat up if the economy does not improve ,'' said Chandra Muzaffar , a professor of political science at the University of Malaya . </s> <s> `` Then the whole question of Mahathir and his leadership will remain an issue .'' </s> <s> In that regard , at least , the leaders who converge on Kuala Lumpur in two weeks will be able to identify with their embattled host . </s> </p> </d> 	abstract=<d> <p> <s> Malaysian capital controls an issue at economic summit </s> </p> </d> 	filename=NYT19981105.0538	publisher=AFP
